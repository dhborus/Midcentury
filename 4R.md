#  Chapter Four:

## The De-centered Search for the Centered Self
\
\
In his second novel, *Giovanni's Room* (1956), James Baldwin has his narrator-protagonist David muse on why he lit out suddenly for Europe. David did so, he reflects, for the peculiarly American reason that he “wanted to find myself.” He notes regards that phrase is neither current “in the language of any other people” and “certainly does not mean what it says but betrays a nagging suspicion that something has been misplaced.” The sojourn to the Old World does little to render David’s desires, inclinations, and capacities legible or stable. Unable to accept his homosexual longings, particularly for the titular character whom he abandons in the face of his conviction and execution for murder, David ends alienated from his very physical being, baffled when looking in the mirror by “what moves in this body” and for “what this body is searching.”[@baldwin1956, p. 39, 189]

Contemporary critics found fault not only with the novel's unapologetic treatment of homosexuality but also its lack of coverage of black life and accused Baldwin of decadence and elitism. They missed, however, the central contention of Baldwin's fiction and nonfiction alike: the race problem originated in whites' inability to know themselves. Baldwin was only one of many artists and scholars who held that postwar American society made it difficult for Americans to develop a firm sense of who they were, allow consistent personal expression or reliably foster expanded capacities. As the leading exemplar of modernity, the United States was, the argument went, especially prone to psychic upheavals and fragmentation despite the often placid exterior of its citizens. Writing in 1962, the husband and wife team Mary and Eric Josephson laid blame for such psycho-social disorders as loss of self, anxiety states, despair, rootlessness, apathy, meaninglessness, and loss of beliefs and values on the absence of meaningful communities and interpersonal relations. Other commentators blamed corporate bureaucracy, advertising, and a wide array of institutional demands for conformity such as schools, the media, and a whole slew of new communities that emphasized the isolation of the nuclear family.[^2]

Postwar concern about the insubstantiality of selves quickly assumed a political cast. Material and objective causes did not, most analysts contended, fully explanation popular support for Fascist and Communist regimes.  Mass intolerance and antidemocratic movements were best explained by psychosocial abnormalities. Erich Fromm's *Escape from Freedom* (1941), Theodor Adorno's *Authoritarian Personality* (1950), and Hannah Arendt's *Origin of Totalitarianism* all attributed totalitarian success to the ability of ruling groups to manipulate unfulfilled psychological needs. Although fascist and communist ideologies had little appeal to most Americans, many commentators nonetheless worried that a society of anomic individuals who lacked internalized standards were fodder for poseurs and demagogues. That possibility no doubt fanned an interest in Tocqueville's argument that democracy produced citizens who sought safety i a culture of stifling uniformity and who were capable of massing against those who were distinctive or different.[^3] Augmenting the theoretical work of the social critics was that of social psychologists in a series of experiments Solomon Asch and Stanley Milgram obtained results that suggested most individuals lacked the psychological assuredness to resist a relentless majority or a demanding, unfeeling authority. Asch (1951, 1956) observed that subjects more often than not acceded to the group truth, even when it countered their own perceptions. For his part, Milgram discovered that most people would continue to punish others when ordered to do so. There was, many observers concluded a "Good German" in all of us.[^4]

In meeting the growing weight of expectations placed on the self, Americans increasingly looked to psychological discourse or therapy rather than religion or philosophy, as would have been the case in the past. Where once Americans examined the state of their souls, their postwar counterparts more often than not turned their attention to their mental and emotional makeup. Emblematic of the shift was Rabbi Joshua Liebman's best-selling *Peace of Mind* (1947), which blended Talmudic wisdom with Freudian insight and the rapid rise of pastoral counseling.[^5] Noteworthy too was the growth in the psychological profession. Five times as many doctorates in psychology were awarded in the 1950s as the decade before. The number of psychiatrists increased ten fold from 1939 to 1959.[@scull2010] With numbers came a new prestige. Robert Linder’s *Fifty-Minute Hour* (1955) was indicative of the midcentury tendency to extol the psychiatrist as seer and depth psychology as the royal road to understanding motivation -- a tendency that informed a spate of movies ranging from Alfred Hitchcock's *Spellbound* (1945) to John Houston's *Freud* (1962). Nor was Freud the only psychological seer. His rival Carl Jung was extraordinarily influential, especially in the growing field of personality testing. Two instruments -- the Thematic Apperception Test and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator -- were deeply indebted to Jung's *Psychological Types* (1923).[@emre2018, p. 89-224] Small wonder, then, that *Life* Magazine hailed the 1950s as the "Age of Psychology."[^7]

Efforts to secure selves aware of and comfortable their capacities and inclinations proceeded along a number of distinct but related paths. Some contended that a tangible foundation for selfhood lay in understanding and accepting humanity's physicality. Debates over whether physical needs and drives escaped self control or whether selfhood was a consequence of dominion over the corporeal often shaded into questions over the relation between self and society. Many of those who granted the contribution to selfhood of the type of body an individual possessed also insisted that humans were **social** animals. At stake was whether American society press too much on individual development or whether social bonds had become too attenuated. Such questions often took the form of a major theme of the postwar period, loneliness. Although the phenomenon of teenagers as a distinct cohort came to fore because of their emergence as a separate market and from worries whether they could meet the political and social challenges thought to be ahead in the Cold War, it is also beneficial to note that the stage of life was one in which physical changes and peer pressures coincided.


### Body and Self

For much of the first half of the twentieth century, eugenics and the biological determinism on which it rested were well respected ways of linking body and selfhood. Deployed to explain such traits as alcoholism, intelligence, and insanity, the mode of understanding provided justification for psychiatric hospitals' programs of sterilization. Nazi genocide did much to discredit the approach. Yet biological explanations for self and identity continued to circulate in American cultural and intellectual life. Not only did explanations for the self rooted in the type of body one possessed enable commentators to locate a center in human nature, talk of a biological foundation, as Nadine Weidman has observed, had the advantage of providing a challenge to Soviet claims to be building the new human.[@weidman2012]

No one was as insistent that the self was a function of body as psychologist William Sheldon (1898-1977). The godson of William James, Sheldon drew upon post-Mendelian modern genetics with its emphasis on multiple determinants of traits to lay out an elaborate form of somatic classification. His scheme rated physiques along scales that ran from one to seven based of their sphericality, muscularity and linearity, which allowed Sheldon to assign each body a three-digit number. Sheldon maintained that somatotypes did not change over time, even with weight change. He took a similar approach with personality, ranking on the basis of sixty traits that he claimed originated in bodily need and which fell into clusters around relaxation, muscular activity involving action and power, and restraint and inhibition. People with prominent guts (endomorphs) craved relaxation and pampering---both somatic and psychological. Muscle-bound men were driven toward action and power and took little note of others, and so on. Although Sheldon conceded both that traits could appear in different forms and that there were numerous cases in which morphologies did not match with manifest temperaments, he never doubted physique was destiny. Not surprisingly, somatotypers were prone to snap judgments. Physical anthropologist Carl Seltzer breezily contended that weak (effeminate by his lights) body types (about 15% of the white, male population) were likely to lack psychic energy, proper motivation, sociability, and appropriate values. Sheldon applauded the 1-7-2 body (which had the highest muscularity and little sphericality or linearity) as the “incarnation of a heroic ideal,” the “masculine ideal of warlike and conquesting people,” the “American eagle of somatotypes” and claimed that the type was most often found in those who traced their heritage to Anglo-Saxon countries. His animal analogies for other categories were less complimentary.[^10]

Sheldon’s overt racism, support for eugenics, and ornery personality initially proved no obstacle to widespread acceptance of his “science.” Tapping the desire for grounded and knowable self, Sheldon's contention that the self was a consequence of its bodily form lay people and professionals alike a way to comprehend and classify the seeming diversity of human behavior and inclinations. Magazines ran such articles as “What Manner of Morph Are You?” and “How Your Shape Shapes Your Life.” Psychologists subjected numerous Ivy League freshmen to nude photographing sessions and psychological probing when arriving on campus. By the mid-1950s, however, Sheldonism was under critical scrutiny. Detractors charged he mixed causation with correlation, ignored changes in body type, offered “just so” stories as explanations, and had failed to produce convincing results despite years of measuring. His research assistant simply confirmed what critics suspected when she claimed he fudged his classifications so that body and personality type meshed.[^11]

Alfred Kinsey’s approach to the body-self relation has proven more politically and intellectually credible than Sheldon’s. A biologist who claimed to have no vested interest in the outcome, he undertook his famous reports on human sexual behavior as “first of all a report on what people do, which raises no question of what they should do.” Kinsey and his associates obtained data that previous investigators had not on such seemingly taboo acts as masturbation, homosexual contact, and non-marital intercourse through innovative interview techniques. The results were surprising to many. Acts thought rare and often morally out of bounds turned out to be fairly common. Taken together, the non-heterosexual, non-marital acts outnumbered marital ones. Given individuals in a variety of different acts, Kinsey classified people not dichotomously but along a spectrum. One was not gay or straight but engaged in primarily one or both acts. Taking a decidedly amoral and biological position, Kinsey dismissed the views of those who regarded some acts immoral, criticizing those who did not “want to believe that there are gradations in these matters from one to the other extreme.”[^12] For Kinsey, all acts were undertaken for sexual release, or “outlet,” and were biologically commensurate. In subsequent years, detractors criticized his emphasis on outlet for its assumption of a male norm of sexuality, but the measure also allowed Kinsey to challenge the belief that the vaginal orgasm was the ultimate female sexual experience and to worry that women were not achieving outlet on par with men.

Kinsey’s work struck a chord. Published by a small medical press, the *Reports* became best-sellers. The male version (1948) sold nearly 250,000 copies and its female counterpart (1954) eventually surpassed that figure. Americans had become, in the expression of the day, “Kinsey conscious.” Kinsey himself assumed celebrity status, mentioned in Cole Porter’s “Too Darn Hot” from *Kiss Me, Kate*. The reports spurred unprecedented public talk about sex and raised questions about what was normal. Many readers indicated to Kinsey that they sought reassurance by checking his charts and graphs to determine where they fell on his scales. Other readers had more pressing concerns. Haunted by urges and acts often deemed abnormal, many wrote to Kinsey for advice and help. Whether his reassurances soothed their troubles, he forthrightly articulated to those who felt outside the pale that conventional standards were arbitrary, not natural, and need not govern their self-understanding.

Debate over the reports was especially fierce. Lay critics accused Kinsey of encouraging immoral and harmful behavior. Academics concentrated primarily on his methodology and his assumptions. His sample was less diverse than he implied. His American data hardly allowed for generalization to males or females in general. Even as a measure of the United States, the data were limited. As a number of critics noted at the time, his surveys over-represented some groups (whites, middle-class women) and under-represented or excluded others (African Americans were, for reasons Kinsey never made clear, excluded from the volume on female sexual behavior). To survey lower-class men (Kinsey wanted to account for differences in status, income, and age), the report used prisons on the debatable assumption that imprisonment was part of the lower-class cultural norm. Kinsey was also selective in the acts he chose to count, ignoring not just acts that did not lead to orgasm but also group sex, sadism, masochism, and transvestism as too marginal. As Sarah Igo has pointed out, the entire project had an ironic edge in that Kinsey envisioned his statistics as necessary to prevent an individual becoming "unique and unexplainable except through an elaborate investigation of him as an isolated entity," lay the groundwork for judgments of “average” as ”normal."[^13]

For many psychiatrists, psychologists and social scientists, however, the problem with the reports was not the revelations about homosexuality or extramarital sexuality but the naturalistic assumptions that concentrated on outlet to the detriment of meaning. All the information in the reports were unlikely to help Americans find themselves, psychiatrists charged, because they had nothing to say about internal states. By ignoring the complexity of consciousness, Kinsey reduced the self to mere biological reflexes and all choice to acting on impulse. By pruning the meaning of a sexual act to release of energy, Kinsey obfuscated the uniqueness of individual sexual lives. His description of sex made no mention of relationships, the institutional context in which sex took place. “Love,” which many critics took to be the culturally sanctioned goal of sex, was absent from the Kinsey investigations. The anthropologist Ashley Montagu complained that Kinsey’s report ignored emotions altogether. The literary critic and advocate of Freud Lionel Trilling argued that Kinsey equated the natural with the good. “Although,” Trilling wrote “the Report directs the harshest language toward the idea of the Normal, saying that it has stood in the way of any true scientific knowledge of sex, it is itself by no means averse to letting the idea of the Natural develop quietly into the idea of the Normal.” That surreptitious assumption, Trilling continued, was why the Kinsey Report “has an extravagant fear of all ideas that do not seem to it to be, as it were, immediately dictated by simple physical fact.”[^14] Margaret Mead charged that the report shared the faults of the culture it purported to measure, an emphasis on size, numbers, money, publicity, and sales.[^15]

Despite their vocal opposition to Kinsey’s naturalism, many of his critics in fact had become more receptive to anchoring the self in biological foundations. Both Mead and Montagu tempered the cultural relativism of their prewar and war work. Their primary concern in their writings of the late 1940s and 1950s which circulated in such popular venues as *Saturday Review* and *Redbook* emphasized the constraints that the type of body one had placed on the workings of culture and the freedoms of the individual to create her self. The standards that both used to judge cultural life were less those of their prior cultural relativism in which what mattered was how a culture fit a people's circumstances than how well cultures conformed to certain givens. Their culturalism did not disappear but observers could note how muted in had become. Nowhere was this more apparent in discussions of gendering.

Born Israel Ehrenberg in London in 1905, Montagu had begun his career by challenging the coherence of the concept of race in *Man’s Most Dangerous Myth: The Fallacy of Race* (1942). Race was not, he argued, rooted in distinctive biological differences since variation within racial groups was as great as among them. Nor did physical markers dictate mental or moral differences. In his draft of the UNESCO statement on race in 1950, Montagu drew on the vitalist biology of the anarchist Petr Kropotkin to insist on a common human nature formed by a biological drive for cooperation. His denial of mental and temperamental differences provoked scholarly criticism for his tendency to overgeneralize from limited evidence. It also led to attacks for alleged Communism, which cost him a position at Rutgers. Carving out a niche for himself as a public expert, he turned his attention to sex differences with *The Natural Superiority of Women* (1953).

Women, Montagu asserted, were naturally healthier and more intelligent than men, which were qualities that followed from their inclination for cooperation. Most importantly women benefitted psychologically from their physical closeness to children. Montagu’s argument posited an ironclad linkage between biological attributes and social role, which in turn created the valuable components of culture. Montagu envisioned women as the agents of cooperation, altruism and love. “*It is the function of women to teach men how to be human*,” he declared. Women’s biological makeup better suited them for bolstering human relations than for engaging in competitive or solitary pursuits. Given his cooperative ethos, Montagu emphasized female nurturing to give anthropological imprimatur to the gender divisions of American democracy. “It is not for nothing,” he continued in defense of a division of functions, “that the Bolsheviks attempted to abolished the family and masculinize women, while the Nazis made informers of children against their parents, and put the State so much before the family that it became a behemoth that well-nigh destroyed everyone who was victimized by it.”[@montagu1953, p. 143, 147 Emphasis in the original.]

Montagu saw little variation among cultures; race, class, nation, or region did not significantly alter the primacy of biological endowment, a reversal of his earlier work. Although sometimes regarded as a precursor of modern feminism because of his praise of female intelligence, creativity and fellow feeling, Montagu was not so much advocating a redistribution of power or role change as securing the foundational qualities of the female self. It was, the feminist Eve Merriam wrote, a left-handed compliment from someone whose pre-eminent position enabled such generosity.[@merriam1964, p. 187]

Mead might have made an even sharper biological turn. In 1958, Mead’s interest in biology as a factor in personality development had progressed to the point that she hired Barbara Heath, Sheldon’s former assistant, to do somatotypes in Papua New Guinea. By the early 1960s, she had found some affinity with Konrad Lorenz, the Austrian ethologist whose work on imprinting and on aggression articulated perhaps the most prominent version of biological influence on formation of the self. Her postwar consideration of the biological determinants of self began with her *Male and Female* (1949). Mead argued that biological divide between male and female was not limited to the obvious differences in sexual organs and role in reproduction. She discerned contrasts in energy, attention, perception, and initiative. She also insisted that the female self, whatever else it accomplished, was inextricably engaged with the emotional development of children since its body was the generator of mother love.

That anatomical differences generated different selves represented a change in emphasis from Mead’s earlier work. *Coming of Age in Samoa* (1928) and *Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies* (1935) stressed human flexibility and plasticity in sexual orientations, character traits, and role; *Male and Female* emphasized the universality of division and the limits on plasticity. Mead not only emphasized the split between the sexes in child birth and rearing but further contended that biological differences were at the base of all cultures. All cultures, she insisted, parceled out typical cultural traits along sexual lines. Crucially, however, cultures did not separate male and female in the same ways. There were, Mead argued, no personality traits that were exclusively male or female. Different cultures regarded beauty, intelligence, kindness, or friendliness in different ways. Bravery was not solely a male trait; cooperation did not belong solely to females. In the end, Mead iterated that insistence on rigid gender roles was the basis of much “inequality and waste in the world.”[@mead1949]

Squaring her recognition of biological difference and her hope for a more flexible expectations of women's personalities took some doing. As with her earlier work, *Male and Female* was both field research report and cultural criticism of the United States. She continued to criticize prudery about somatic functions (including sexual desire) and its inversion, the excessive eroticization of bodies. Both prudery and eroticization inhibited the ability of Americans to feel at home in their own bodies(p. 141). Mead was especially critical of the withdrawal of fathers from parenting responsibilities. Ironically it was American mothers who reminded boys to act like men. It was a crucial instance of Mead's fundamental complaint that the "problem" was women, rather than relations between men and women. "As surely as we believe that the present troublesome problems of sex adjustment are due to the position of women alone we commit ourselves to a long series of false moves as we attempt to push women out of the home, into the home, out of the home, adding mounting confusion of the difficulties born of a changing world . . . ”(pp. 299-301). Among moves that Mead considered false were not simply restriction of female intelligence and male sensitivity as abnormal but a social refusal to let gender differences play out.

Later feminists criticized Mead's talk of female docility and the essential nature of mother love, but its insistence on the development of a wide variety of female capabilities and its pleas for flexibility in gender relations made *Male and Female* different from the widely circulated anti-feminist tract *Modern Woman: The Lost Sex* (1947) by Ferdinand Lundberg and Marynia Farnham.  Lundberg and Farnham's screed excoriated American women for their unnatural abandonment of motherhood and domestic life -- two roles for which they were suited. Influenced by the feminist movement and war-time employment, American women no longer found satisfaction in child-bearing. As mothers, they tended to be rejecting, overprotective, domineering, or over-affectionate. Any of the four types were responsible neurotic and unhappy children, which Lundberg and Farnham estimated constituted one fourth to one third of the population.[^19]

Lundberg and Farnham frequently claimed the mantle of Freud, but both psychoanalysts and Neo-Freudians found their work simplistic.[See @zaretsky2000, p. 338-41] At issue in postwar debates over the uses of Freud was the nature of the energy provided by drives or impulses and how modifiable they were by social institutions. Freud’s understanding of the formation of the self had matured over the course of his career, but a fairly constant portion was libido theory. In it, Freud held that *trieb* (alternatively translated as “drives” or “instinct”) were fundamentally sexual in nature. The energy focuses on different zones at different moments in an individual’s childhood. Should it become fixated on certain parts, psychopathology would arise. Drives are relentless and fundamentally antisocial, leading to efforts to regulate them. This regulation could be conscious (suppression), unconscious (repression through internalization of social prohibitions and norms), or channeled (sublimation). Freud envisioned the individual as continually at odds with him or herself, yet capable of some forms of psychic health by using the energy of the drives for work and love.[^20]

Although revisionists accepted Freud’s notion of a depth psychology in which unconscious motivation--retrievable through dreams, fantasies, and slips--accounted for external behavior, they rejected the libido theory. Such analysts as Erik Erikson, Karen Horney, Harry Stack Sullivan, and Erich Fromm challenged the exclusive concentration on the erotic, Freud’s hydraulic conception of energy that limited the amount available to an individual, and the orthodox assertion of the universality of Oedipal conflict. Revisionists charged that empirical evidence was lacking for all these propositions. Others criticized Freud’s version of female sexuality in which girls transfer desire from mother to father and yearn for a penis as incoherent. At bottom, they objected to a view of biological endowment as unalterable and proposed instead a view in which the self under the impress of nature and society was more variable, dynamic, and contingent.[^21]

With its emphasis on social context rather than biologically-based drives, revisionism opened the possibility of connecting psychological development to political change. Most notable in this regard was Erich Fromm, who discerned commonalities between Freud and Marx. “Different as they were, they have in common an uncompromising will to liberate man, an equally uncompromising faith in truth as the instrument of liberation and the belief that the condition for this liberation lies in man's capacity to break the chain of illusion.”[^22] In Fromm’s synthesis, dynamic psychology provided the mechanism by which social existence gave rise to consciousness while historical materialism contributed an etiology to why certain character types predominated at different times in human history. Fromm believed libidinal theory could not convincingly explain why a particular social class featured a particular character type. It was unlikely, he thought, that every petit bourgeois had anal fixations. If the human instinctual apparatus was not infinitely malleable, it nonetheless changed in response to the historical problems it faced. Fromm’s revisionism was most apparent in his view of the family as the conduit of historical context through the particular bodily and psychic gratification structure. As long as it bestowed the proper rewards, the family would give rise to the typical character type. Should families cease to deliver rewards, the stage was set for new character types and social change.[^23]

If Fromm jettisoned orthodoxy for radical ends, others hewed to it for similar reasons. Although the analytic establishment used Freud to secure patient adjustment to normal social life, thinkers diverse as Herbert Marcuse, Lionel Trilling, and the sociologist Dennis Wrong glimpsed in Freudian libido theory the possibility of true opposition to the political and social status quo. They held that the drives did *not* set the self forever but opened possibilities for overturning social convention. Revisionists had treated nature as a form of determinism, but their work relied on what Wrong termed the oversocialized conception of man (sic). By positing social and cultural causation activated by an ingrained need for approval, revisionism turned out at bottom to be a theory of conformity in which rebels were incompletely socialized.[@wrong1961] Freud himself was dismissive of social revolution, but his conception of the self caught between drive and internalized social restriction was a portrait of a person in struggle. Aware that the manifestation of instincts was not fixed, defenders of the libido theory envisioned ways that redirected instincts could aid nonconformist ends. Literary critic Lionel Trilling championed the biological substratum that remained beyond conformity to culture. By viewing the self as struggling against its culture, Trilling's Freud presented a way that individuals could stand outside culture. That biology could underwrite a different kind of conformity was less worrying to Trilling in the 1950s when culture seemed so demanding than it was to the neo-Freudians and it would be to subsequent liberals. [@trilling1955, particularly 38-58]

Trilling, especially in his later career, included Freud's death drive as part of humanity's biological equipment, a sense that human's tended toward stasis, even destruction, which prevented him from embracing Utopian visions. Not so, the Marxist philosopher Marcuse, who treated the unleashing of eros as an attack on capitalist society’s conversion of sex energy into alienated labor. “The irreconcilable conflict is not between work (reality principle) and Eros (pleasure principle), but between alienated labour (performance principle) and Eros,” Marcuse proclaimed.[^25] Marcuse's rejection of neo-Freudianism led him to flirt with the non-Marxist position that bodily pleasure the sole measure of meaningful selfhood, underplaying the contributions of Enlightenment reason. A fear that American culture might co-opt the supposedly liberated aspects of instinctual life later led Marcuse to advance the idea of repressive desublimation in *One-Dimensional Man* (1964). As Marcuse saw it, by allowing, encouraging, and commodifying instant gratification, capitalist society drained energies that could be used in opposition. Ostensible liberation turned out to bolster the prevailing order.

Although most debate revolved around how the body determined identity, there were instances where self and body became unconnected and revealed how plastic gender behavior could be. Some were played for fun, as in Billy Wilder’s film *Some Like It Hot* (1959), in which Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis dress and live as women to escape gangsters. Others, such as the case of Christine Jorgensen went to the heart of body and identity. Although born with a penis, George William Jorgensen felt early on as a child that she was a woman trapped in a man’s body. Although psychoanalysts regarded such a condition as a mental illness, the result of improper identification with the properly sexed parent during early childhood, medical doctors regarded the condition as inadequate physical development of the proper sexual characteristics. Beginning hormone therapy with the husband of a classmate, Jorgensen traveled to Europe to have sex reassignment surgery which she completed in Denmark in 1951 and 1952. Jorgensen became an instant celebrity upon her return to the United States. Often an object of derisive humor, Jorgensen responded by adopting a glamorous and outgoing persona, quite different from her diffidence as a boy. Forbidden from marrying (her birth certificate indicated she was male), she nonetheless by her very existence demonstrated that gender was not a binary, incommensurate condition and that genitalia and chromosomes alone did not provide a completely solid foundation for identity.[^26]

**The Crowd and the Lonely**



Midcentury Americans were inveterate joiners. Such organizations as the Boy Scouts, Parent-Teachers Association and the League of Women Voters experienced tremendous growth from 1950 to 1960, virtually doubling during the period. Even some sales unfolded in a group environment. The much-derided Tupperware---plastic covered dishes intended to store leftovers ---was founded in 1948 and rose to cultural prominence and lucrative returns on the strength of its marketing through “Tupperware parties” of friends and neighbors. Many commentators complained about the pressure to belong and conform and the suspicion that attached to outsiders and loners. Yet observers also claimed the connections of bowling leagues and other civil society groups were particularly thin and unfulfilling. American life, it seemed, oscillated between anchoring the individual too firmly to allow growth and experimentation and too loosely to convey security. The upshot in either case was a growing worry about Americans' ability to know who they were.[^29]

Although there is very little discussion of loneliness as the term is usually understood, David Riesman’s *Lonely Crowd* (1950) takes as its central problem the changing relationship of the self and others. Riesman developed an interest in sociology during his analysis with Erich Fromm. Originally, he and his associates Reuel Denney and Nathan Glazer set out to study apathy during the 1948 presidential election; the project morphed into a study of which abstract character type predominated at a given stage of the past. Where once the prevailing personality type was inner-directed, transformation in social organization --- particularly the rise of bureaucracy and mass communications --- gave rise to the other-directed type. Inner-directeds, as the name suggests, subscribed to values and followed a code of behavior she or he has internalized. In contrast, other-directed people took their cues from social expectations and the reactions of their fellows. Inner-directed folks gained identity primarily from work; outer-directeds organized their self-conception around leisure and consumption. The other directed lived lives filled with anxiety, as opposed to the inner-directed’s guilt.

Sparked by a cover story in *Time Magazine* on Riesman and the American character in 1954, many readers interpreted Riesman’s book as deploring the rise of the other-directed personality, which they saw as conformist, insecure, and dependent. They read into his portrait of the inner-directed man as self-contained, ambitious, and better at things than with people an elegy for a character type that no longer fit the new world of group work and human relations. Even as the story indicated how well adjusted and social Riesman himself was, the cover reinforced the lament interpretation. It featured a man in a business suit with a radar transmitter on his back looking to the future and the Victorian figure with a compass moving back into the mists of the past while the faceless masses congregated behind the bespectacled Riesman.[^30]

[^30]: For reception of *Lonely Crowd*, see Eric Larrabee, “David Riesman and His Readers,” in [@lipset1961, 404-16] and Wilfred M. McClay, “The strange career of *The Lonely Crowd*: or, the antimonies of autonomy in [@haskell1993, p. 397-440] Barbara Ehrenreich gives the inner-other directed distinction a gendered reading in [@ehrenreich1983, p. 35]

Riesman denied he was simply lamenting the decline of nineteenth-century individualism or criticizing conformity as such. Riesman was clear that the issue was *how*, not whether, a society induces conformity. Nineteenth-century America did so through a similar internal code that resulted in envy and emulation among inner-directed strivers. The other-directed, he noted, conformed from an “greater resonance with others, a heightened self-consciousness about relations to people, and a widening of the circle with whom one wants to feel in touch.” Nor did he think the inner-directed personality was particularly admirable, pointing to its crabbed, constricted and parochial nature. The inner-directed man may have had his internal code, but the circle of others who were acceptable was quite small and his inner censor could be unproductively unforgiving. Inner direction may have suited the class-conflict ridden stage of capitalism but was hardly the model for personal freedom in the modern age.[^31]

Yet Riesman hardly depicted the other-directed as models of meaningful and self-aware selfhood. Other-direction enabled insincere glad-handing and mood engineering designed to influence vaguely discomforted individuals uncertain about whether or not they fit in. Riesman's other-directed personality resembled Fromm’s marketing personality, who treated his self as if it were a commodity. Because they drew identity from consumption rather than work, other-directeds were especially vulnerable to swings in fashion. Like Arthur Miller’s Willie Loman in *Death of a Salesman* (1949), other-directeds were often convinced they had “sterling traits of character” and “a pleasing personality” and often found it difficult to face reality. Riesman did envision positive aspects to other-direction. The other-directed self was aware of others and had the capacity to be more empathetic, sensitive, tolerant, and flexible. Riesman contended that the other-directed were more prone to examining inner life and better suited to a world in which work had been so degraded that it could no longer contribute to a worthwhile identity. Since it was an emerging orientation, the other-directed heralded either a new openness or a therapeutic world view in which attention to one’s feelings trumped all other considerations.

The most tantalizing but least realized portion of the book was Riesman’s discussion of autonomy. Riesman believed that since the problem of production had been virtually solved, freedom was a psychosocial rather than a material challenge. Although Riesman had noted in a letter to Denney the possibility that in some circumstances alienation could be a legitimate response to a society that bore down too heavily on individuals, he ultimately tended to regard the condition as anomie, the breakdown of social connection and norms. More preferable was autonomy, which he conceded was relatively rare, especially in a regime of outer-direction. He envisioned autonomy achieved through membership in multiple communities, creative consumption by which he meant knowledgeable use of an item, and the ability to know and master one’s own desires. The details remained exceedingly vague. He did insist, however, that creativity amidst the general joylessness of modern life was essential. In response, Daniel Bell termed him a prophet of play who overemphasized the degree to which consumption yielded the kind of freedom that Riesman wanted. Indeed, by the late 1960s, Riesman worried that efforts to go one’s own way had become willful efforts to depart from norms for their own sake, as if eccentricity proved one was not other-directed.

Others were less subtle than Riesman. Both William Whyte and Vance Packard were deeply critical of institutional exploitation of fears of being different, a tendency they saw as a defining feature of modern bureaucratic life. Whyte and Packard regarded the corporation as the nerve-center of a collectivist culture in which ostensibly free individuals fear differences from their fellows and act accordingly. The point of "keeping up with the Joneses" was less a desire for material improvement but a descriptive of the psychic good life. Whyte termed the phenomenon “groupthink,” the conscious justification for conformity on the grounds that group wisdom was superior to that of individuals. With “groupthink” came personality transformation. "Groupthink" flowed from the cubicles of the corporation to the A-frames of suburbia, with, as the Malvina Reynolds' song had it, its "little boxes" made of "ticky-tacky" all in a row. The similarity of the exteriors signified the conformity inside what Betty Friedan called "a comfortable concentration camp. Packard’s criticism was directed at institutions of manipulation and standardization, such as advertising, product design, and public relations. Although influential, Packard and Whyte’s broadsides proved overstated --- the suburbs, including the supposed epitome of conformity, Levittown, were much less conformist than they claimed. Nor could they offer any meaningful way to oppose conformity. The best alternative that Whyte could offer was an appendix on cheating on personality tests.[^32]

[^32]: Daniel Horowitz has the definitive biography of Vance Packard, [@horowitz1994] In a subsequent volume, he points to the way abundance and consumerism changed social criticism.[@horowitz2004] Criticism of the conformist view of the suburbs can be found in Herbert J. Gans, *The Levittowners: Ways of Life and Politics in a New Suburban Community* (New York: Institute of Urban Studies, Teachers College, Columbia University, 1965). Criticism of Packard can be found in Lewis Coser, “Kitsch Sociology” *Partisan Review* (Summer 1959): 480-3. Whyte’s guide to cheating on personality tests is the Appendix to *The Organization Man*, 405-10.

Whyte and Packard’s lament the autonomous self who resisted social pressure was echoed in the popular film genre that enjoyed something of a heyday in midcentury, the Western. The typical 1950s Western probed the social and cultural conflict that arose when rugged individualism lost its social utility. At odds with the direction of history, Western heroes constantly drift or die. Despite their ostensible celebration of their protagonist’s resistance to social demands, midcentury Westerns have an elegiac feel. Heroic bold action ends with complete alienation from the community. John Wayne’s Tom in Howard Hawks’s *Red River* (1948) is a rugged individualist par excellence who demands others bend to his will. He regards others’ needs as a personal attack and treats compromise as weakness. During a crucial cattle drive, his violent and inhumane behavior boils over in a mutiny led by his adopted son, Montgomery Clift’s Matt, whom in a reversal of the Oedipal drama Tom vows to kill. In the case of *Shane* (1953), the titular character is caught between his gunslinging nature and his desire to put his past away. When a cattle baron and his henchmen attempt to engross the fertile land of the valley, threatening the farm family where Shane works and boards, he abandons his pledge, killing the treacherous baron and his hired guns in a showdown. Though the young boy who idolizes him wants Shane to “come back,” Shane intuitively understands the impossibility of a self like his living peaceably with others, even as his skills constitute a precondition for society. In *High Noon* (1952) the incompatibility lies in the unprincipled conformity of those who compose respectful society. Hearing that a criminal, whom he had put away in jail was returning to exact his revenge, sheriff Will Kane (Gary Cooper) feels it incumbent to stand his ground, even though he was about to leave for the East with his new bride. Efforts to recruit help are unavailing and Kane faces the onslaught alone (with the help of his Quaker wife). Often taken as an allegory for Hollywood cravenness in the face of HUAC threats, the film earned praise for Kane’s doing what was right when others would not. Interestingly, Hawks and Wayne could not abide the film on grounds that the townsfolk were cowards and Kane was weak for asking for help and for ultimately being saved by his wife. Ronald Reagan, on the other hand, loved the film.[^33]

Placing the western in the present day only exacerbated the incongruity of the autonomous hero. In *Lonely Are the Brave* (1962), written by the once-blacklisted Dalton Trumbo from eco-anarchist Edward Abbey’s novel *The Brave Cowboy*, loner Jack Burns (Kirk Douglas) proves unable to function in modernity. The film drives the point home from the beginning where Burns at home on the range is discombobulated by screaming jets, gear-shifting trucks that make highway crossings on a horse nearly impossible, and barbed-wire fences that block free passage. Burns makes to trek from the New Mexico mountains to free his friend Paul, who has been jailed for smuggling Mexican refugees into the country. Once in town, Burns sets out to get arrested so he can break Paul out of jail with hacksaw blades he has smuggled into the prison. When family man Paul decides the costs of jail break are greater than doing the time, Burns escapes by himself. Chased by the forces of law and order with its radios and helicopters up the Sandia Mountains, Burns temporarily manages to evade capture, even shooting down a copter. Yet in the midst of trying to cross a highway, his horse once again spooks and Burns is hit by a truck carrying, in an excess of symbolism, a load of toilets.

Douglas secured the rights and hired Trumbo to tell a story about the near impossibility of maintaining authentic individuality in a mass society bent on classifying and regulating its citizens. Burns has no ID cards because he knows who he is. He rejects fences and no trespassing signs because they represent society’s encroachment on his freedom. Director David Miller reinforced the point visually by showing the mountains and deserts of New Mexico in panoramic shots that emphasized the openness and freedom of nature and shooting the machinery and enclosed rooms of civilized society in claustrophobic closeups. In the end, of course, modern civilization would prove triumphant and doom folks like Burns. Yet Trumbo punctuated the requiem for the independent self with a caveat. Burns tells Jerry, Paul’s wife, with whom he was once in love that he was unfit for marriage, “Know what a loner is? He's a born cripple. He's a cripple because the only person he can live with is himself. It's his life, the way he wants to live. It's all for him. A guy like that, he'd kill a woman like you. Because he couldn't love you, not the way you are loved.” Such a scene can be read as an equation of solitude with selfishness. It might also be understood as a reaffirmation of gender differences: only men have the wherewithal to live as they want to live.

Another, less conventional, version of authentic individuality arrived via the Beats, the best-known midcentury bohemians. Convinced that conventional American life demanded sterile routines that denied individuals genuine freedom, the motley collection of writers, poets, and artists stridently asserted their rejection of social norms that repressed impulses, outlawed meaningful experience, and demanded standardization of thought, feeling, and action. In reaction to a society that was overly sentimental and inauthentic, Beats adopted an attitude of cool, a reserved distance from convention. In contrast to middle-class norms of restraint and caution, Beats favored spontaneity. In protest of the mainstream insistence on propriety, Beats embraced the margins of society, seeking out the company of criminals, drugs addicts, deviants, and denigrated minorities. It was this spirt that Jack Kerouac expressed when the narrator of his 1957 novel, *On the Road*, Sal Paradise, declared “the only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones that never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn” and celebrated the black community of Denver because “the best the white world had offered was not enough ecstasy for me, not enough life, joy, kicks, darkness, music, not enough night.”[^34]

Most unsympathetic commentators regarded Beats as conformist in their nonconformity and engaged in a juvenile reaction against adulthood. Writing in the *Partisan* Review, Norman Podhoretz lambasted their worship of primitive energy: “The plain truth is that the primitivism of the Beat Generation serves first of all as a cover for an anti-intellectualism so bitter that it makes the ordinary American’s hatred of eggheads seem positively benign.”[^35] Others saw racial stereotyping in the guise of admiration and a disregard for women’s contributions. Yet Beats were more than nay-saying hedonists. They overestimated the freedom they had achieved, but their quest to embrace experiences mainstream American frowned upon entailed a project of constructing a self unfettered by social boundaries whatsoever. As their embrace of madness indicates, the Beats regarded sanity as encasing and restricting the self. Drawing an eclectic mix of philosophical elements ranging from Eastern religion to the mysticism of William Blake, the Beats were even ready to jettison the self altogether as an illusion. The Beat self, William Burroughs observed needed to learn “to exist with no religion, no country, no allies” and “to live alone in silence.” Coming from a left-wing Jewish family, Allen Ginsberg could condemn in “America” (1956), a United States that committed crimes against Tom Mooney, Spanish Loyalists, and Scottsboro Boys and that sported such cultural monstrosities as television, *Time* magazine, and Henry Ford. Yet his resistance to the prison of centered selfhood enabled him to make common cause with the libertarian Burroughs and the Catholic anti-Communist Kerouac.[^36]

Beat spontaneity did not result in a consistent philosophy. More philosophically sophisticated in its consideration of the meaning and dilemmas of identity was existentialism. Although as historian George Cotkin has argued several strains of American thought had existential themes, the philosophy did not take hold until European versions arrived in mid-twentieth century. The thought of Soren Kierkegaard, introduced through the efforts of neo-Orthodox Episcopal minister, Walter Lowrie, led figures as diverse as Reinhold Niebuhr, Will Herberg, Whitaker Chambers, and Arthur Schlesinger, Junior to temper or reject their one-time expansive hopes for social transformation. Existentialism gathered steam with the New York intellectuals’ discovery and promotion of the French writers, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and Albert Camus in the mid-1940s, but all three had unsatisfactory visits to United States. Their hosts criticized the existentialists for their flirtation with Marxism (Camus being an exception), shallow knowledge of Freud, and mass-media posturing. Nonetheless existentialism remained attractive as a philosophy of authenticity that enjoined individuals not to accept fate but instead create their identities as singular, unique beings. More than the pose of Greenwich Village coffeehouse habitués, existentialism proved a bracing challenge and support for those searching for an understanding of where they stood in the world. One sign of its success was the appearance of such academic efforts to provide meaningful genealogies and commentary as Hazel Barnes’s *The Literature of Possibility* (1957) and Walter Kaufmann’s *Existentialism From Dostoevsky to Sartre* (1956). By the mid-1960s, existentialism had profoundly affected the novelists Anne Rice and Marge Piercy, the feminist Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, and radicals Tom Hayden and Robert Moses, and, ironically, given their opposing sexual politics, Betty Friedan and Norman Mailer.[^37]

Existentialism defined the human condition as strikingly individual. Though humans live in groups, our consciousness and our death were ours alone. Where determinisms wrongly subsumed particulars under abstract and ultimately meaningless concepts, existentialism was concerned with recognizing contingencies and making rather than discovering truth. At the core of things was the necessity of human choice. It was the inescapability of making choices and creating an identity that gave meaning to the famous Sartrean aphorism that existence precedes essence. Many of those choices were crucial ones that could not be fudged and committed one to a particular course, “either/or” in the parlance rather than “both/and.” Even though the world was absurd in the sense that meaning was not given, having to make a choice conferred a seriousness to life and required individuals to assume responsibility for whom one was and whom one became. One could not evade the responsibility of choice even if one occupied a lowly social position or suffered through oppressive conditions, a point Camus advanced in his “Myth of Sisyphus.” Condemned to the absurdity of forever pushing a boulder up a mountain, Sisyphus nonetheless differed from the inhuman boulder because he retained the ability to deny fate and make deliberate choices about what he would do. Sartre labeled bad faith any denial of responsibility for one’s situation. It was inauthentic to simply shrug one’s shoulders and assert this is just the way I am. Borrowing from phenomenological discussion of consciousness, Sartre asserted resignation denied our awareness, however dim and distant, that we are always more than ourselves. Existentialists insisted there was no greater inauthenticity than accepting without passionate engagement and choice social conventions.

Although Sartre once wrote “hell is other people,” existentialists were wary of blithe libertarianism and the egoism of exclusive self regard. Having condemned the bad faith of acquiescing in a socially-imposed identity, existentialists also challenged the bad faith of pretending antecedent conditions had no effect whatsoever, as if all things were possible. One of those antecedent conditions that the French recognized was society itself. That recognition gave the politics of the existentialists social concerns. For de Beauvoir, authenticity required an open future which extends itself by opening the freedom of others. It also presented Sartre and de Beauvoir with the task of squaring the individual freedom of existentialism expounded in “Existentialism is Humanism” with the social causation of Marxism. Sartre’s effort to weave together collective and individual action in *The Critique of Dialectical Reason* was at best only partially successful. The liberal Camus regarded the project as utopian politics because it treated class as an abstraction and justified positions on the grounds of historical necessity. Doing so necessarily drained values from political action and substituted revolutionary fervor for regard for others. Concerned to keep means and ends in balance, Camus opted for a reformist politics that accepted in some fashion the positions of others. That stance could founder on the search for an unachievable middle position, as in his untenable hope that the Algerian crisis could be resolved in a compromise that left French nationals in their unique place in the colony while honoring the desire of indigenous Algerians for independence. Camus nonetheless proved tremendously inspiring for Americans eager for a new politics that combined the individual authenticity of social opposition with an acceptance of legitimate social bonds. His influence could be found in such documents of the New Left as *The Port Huron Statement* and *Liberation* magazine.

Worry over the legitimacy of social bonds accounted for the constant talk about alienation and the near ubiquity of the phrase “failure to communicate.” It surfaced as well in the widespread prominence of the theme of loneliness in postwar discourse. Artwork as diverse as Nicholas Ray’s *In a Lonely Place* (1950), Hank Williams’s “I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry” (1949), H. J. J. Straelen’s introduction to existentialism, *Man, the Lonely* (1952), Dorothy Day's autobiography, *The Long Loneliness* (1952), Chester Himes’s *Lonely Crusade* (1947), Margaret Wood’s social psychological exploration, *Paths to Loneliness* (1953), and Clark Moustakas’s psychological cum philosophical investigation of *Loneliness* (1961) raised the question of how to make meaningful connections in an age of impersonality. Such concerns testified to a new meaning for the word “lonely.” Previous generations had understood the term to mean feelings arising from being physically alone, the consequence of being friendless or losing a loved one. They regarded the condition as an inescapable part of life. After the war, the term also came to signify feelings of insufficient or unrewarding social connections, feelings that were liable to arise at any moment or with any interaction. Modern loneliness implied something askew in social relations or something lacking in the kinds of people produced by such relations. “Only connect,” E. M. Forester wrote in *Howard’s End* but many worried that connection was simply not possible in American life as currently constituted.

No one at midcentury did a more thorough job of showing the contrast between ideals of togetherness and the less palatable truths of American life than photographer Robert Frank. His *Americans* (1958), criticized at the time for being politically unacceptable and aesthetically bankrupt, has taken on iconic status since. Born to a Swiss Jewish family, Frank came to United States in 1947, working first as a fashion photographer. With the help of famed photographer Walker Evans, Frank won a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1955 to photograph wide swathes of American life. Traveling from coast to coast over the course of two years, Frank took some 28,000 shots of which eighty-three were eventually published in the book. Initially unable to find an American publisher primarily because of his departure from prevailing norms in focus and lighting, Frank succeeded with the French publisher Robert Delpire in 1958 before landing with Grove Press in the United States the following year. Aiding Grove Press’s decision was the introduction provided by Jack Kerouac, who praised for Frank for having “sucked a sad poem right out of America onto film, taking rank among the tragic poets of the world.”[^38] Within the next three years, he had major shows at the Chicago Art Institute and the Museum of Modern Art.

Frank’s aesthetic choices underwrote his thematic ones. His sense that the United States was a lonely, often bleak place stemmed not simply from his experiences but his long-standing opposition to sentimentality and beauty in art as false. He fretted that beauty obscured broader social implications, holding that perfect composition would make it less likely that the viewer would move beyond the frame. In contrast to professional photographers, Frank preferred blurred, grainy, and muddy exposures that he believed opened access to the underlying forces and truth of a situation. Frank rejected lighting that directed viewers to the expressive features of common humanity, opting instead to capture Americans with blank or tormented looks. In his pictures of sparsely populated bars, marching bands in which instruments obscure musicians’ faces, and automobile drivers and passengers unusually cropped to give the impression of unknown destinations and separation from the environments, Frank put a punctuation point on his sense of the desolation of American life.[^39]

Americans’ inability to connect with one another was especially clear in two of his downtown New Orleans photographs. The first captures pedestrians trying to make their way, only to find themselves impeded by a stream heading the other way. Like particles in Brownian motion, they collide, streaming this way and that. All in caught in grim and unsmiling profile. No one is looking at anyone else (one person is taking a wary glance at us, the audience). Some are looking down. Together they create a mass that extends the entire width of the frame. Determined to move onward, they appear to have neither connection with anyone else despite the claustrophobic quality of the image nor apparent destination—a graphic representation of a lonely crowd. The second, more iconic image captures the agonies of urban segregation. The photo, which graced the original cover, was entitled “Trolley New Orleans.” In typical Southern fashion, whites sit in the front and blacks in the rear. All passengers are looking out at us with varying emotions, ranging from contempt or dismissal from the white woman in the second row to anguish on the face of the black man two rows behind her. It is clearly a warm day since the windows are opened. The raised windows distort the reflection from the street and we can make out what might be apartment buildings, bridges, or pedestrians. Whatever they are, they shimmer like mirages. The open windows create an impression of cells in which each of the passengers is sealed off from his or her fellows, an effect driven home by the longing in their looks and the glistening jambs.

Frank did not arrange his photos in chronological order. Nor did he set out to tell a particular story. He did, however, have themes to which he returned --- automobiles, bars, race, and, perhaps most poignant of all, flags. Frank deployed flags not as a symbol of unity but as an unfamiliar and divisive object. In “Parade - Hoboken, New Jersey,” the flag itself serves decapitate. Rather than depicting a parade, the picture shows two apartment dwellers looking out at a parade, or so we assume. The woman in the left window is not fully visible. A white shade is partially drawn, creating a deep shadow. We are only able to make out her chin and mouth. Between the windows is an unfurled flag, blowing in the breeze. Fairly taut, it blows in such a way to make the face of the second woman invisible to us. The flag dominates the composition but it ensures Americans remain unknown to each other. The reality of division stands against the ideal of unity.

The counterpart of Frank in painting was George Tooker. Born in Brooklyn, trained by the famed Depression-era illustrator and chronicler of New York life, Reginald Marsh, Tooker adopted a style of figurative representation, unusual juxtapositions, bleak lighting, and ambiguous or complex perspectives, a style that he called “reality impressed on the mind so hard that it returns as a dream.” His paintings were fantasies or reveries, he insisted, but of a world drained of human interaction, deep emotion and individual initiative. His figures shuffle rather than walk, and often seem isolated, imprisoned, or estranged. Typically an oppressive architecture overwhelms them, as the anonymity and standardization of modern life defines their environment. This approach dominates such works of midcentury as *The Subway* (1950), *Government Bureau* (1955-1956), and *Waiting Room* (1959). In the first, the effects of mass society in all its horror impresses itself on the viewer almost immediately. The multiple vanishing points, the confining cubicles in which numerous people wait or hide, the depressed sorrowful or blank expressions on the riders’ faces, the metal grating, all contribute to the tenor of solitary nature of alienation. Tooker claimed the subway was the epitome of “a denial of the senses and a negation of life itself.”[^40]

Popular song has long trafficked in loneliness, plying the distance between the ideal of love and the reality of abandonment. Midcentury saw more than its share of mawkish tropes. Songs aimed at teenagers, whose inexperience leads them to imagine their condition will last forever, often delighted in the pain as a sign of sensitivity. Occasionally, however, pop songs gave the loneliness a new twist. Although Ricky Nelson cared less for pop ballads than the rockabilly of Sun Records, his father-manager, Ozzie, believed his vocal abilities were more suited for the former, and had him sing on the family’s franchise, the television show *Ozzie and Harriet*. Ricky play himself on the show, which took a fateful turn after Rickey recorded a version of Fats Domino’s “I’m Walkin’” in 1957 to impress his date. After that he performed regularly, boosting the ratings and easing the acceptance of rock ’n’ roll in many American households. “Poor Little Fool,” (1958), “A Teenager’s Romance,” (1957), and “Lonesome Town” (1958) all charted and made Nelson a heart throb. It was that experience that gave credibility to his last great success of his early career, “Teenage Idol” (1962). Much of “Idol” is a standard-issue complaint about the lack of emotional fulfillment in stardom. Those who envy the singer have no way of knowing how lonesome he can be since he’s always passing through, with no time to find someone with whom he can truly talk. In accord with the genre, Nelson maintains fame and fortune won’t mean a thing if he’s all alone. What is noteworthy is the linkage between traveling, stardom and loneliness in a song designed for teenage girls --- something rarely done in midcentury. On the one hand, the troubles of the rich and famous hardly evoke empathy. The obvious retort to the throwaway line about the worthlessness of fame and fortune is to advise the singer to stay home. On the other, the ubiquity of lonesomeness makes the celebrity jes’ folks. The idol is no more suited to escape the nexus of loneliness than any other American, except most other Americans can't sing a song that evoked the desire to relieve Nelson of his loneliness.

It was the contribution of Frank Sinatra to create a body of work that moved beyond predictable laments and conveyed how loneliness dissolved facades and personas, revealing an essential vulnerability. Born in 1915, Sinatra had achieved 1940s success singing for a number of large bands, including Tommy Dorsey and Harry James. A teen idol in the mid-1940s, he hit a rough patch thereafter in which he was reduced to doing novelty songs. Released from his Columbia contract, he staged a comeback in the 1950s with an Oscar for his role in *From Here to Eternity* (1953) and sixteen albums for Capitol in which he reinvented himself as a mature, complex singer. The Capitol albums were not so much random collections of songs than ones organized around a theme or concept. Some featured the hip Sinatra, a jaunty and charming rogue with a jazz sensibility. Contrasting with the swinging Sinatra was the lonely one, who could not transcend the damages of his failed love life and went through his daily life unconnected to and unaware of others. In albums *In the Wee Small Hours* (1955), *Where are You?* (1957), *Only the Lonely* (1958)--which Sinatra called his favorite--and *No One Cares* (1959), Sinatra revealed a self crumbling under the pressure of isolation. Bolstering the effect was the album art, which portrayed a devastated Sinatra in ways few stars of his magnitude would have allowed. *Only the Lonely* featured Sinatra as a clown obscured by a black background so that only half his face is discernible and the visible part touched with red highlights on lips, nose and eyes to give the impression of a crying clown. *No One Cares* has him sitting alone and forlorn bathed in light while all around him couples socialize.[^41]

Sinatra’s 1950s work subtly explored the varieties of loneliness, revealing a self insecure even when appearing confident to others. With the help of arrangers Nelson Riddle and Gordon Jenkins, Sinatra summoned a complex psychological landscape full of precariousness and disquiet. These effects owed much to Sinatra’s talents and musical intelligence. His celebrated breath control enabled him to emulate both the operatic bel canto style, which varied legato and staccato passages while frequently altering tempo, and Dorsey’s trombone virtuosity. With his flexible phrasing and accenting, Sinatra mastered a conversational style of singing that enabled him to project a variety of vulnerabilities, in contrast to the strident, even parodic, masculinity of his “swinging” albums. In fraying his voice or shifting between major and minor keys without musical resolution, Sinatra constructed a singing self that lacked poise and closure. In those cases, where the song, like an operatic recitative, lacked a real tune, Sinatra captured the midcentury despair at the inability of the self to find its center in social life.

Sinatra skillfully moved in his so-called “down” albums between gloom, resignation and disorientation. The immediate causes were failed love affairs or the inability to shake a depressed state that itself intensifies the blows that others delivered. At times reflective, at others accepting, and still others defeated, Sinatra’s songs of loneliness were a marked contrast to the bromides of national happiness and formulaic popular songs like Nelson’s that mention, not inhabit, loneliness. In “Stormy Weather” on *No One Cares*, Sinatra’s voice begins full in a lower register but as he realizes that he just can’t get his “poor self together,” his accents begin to fall irregularly. In his rendition of Rodgers’s and Hart’s “Spring is Here” on *Only the Lonely*, Sinatra achieves great effect in singing in minor key on the wrong accent when singing about moments that are normally would make one merry. One would expect that the rebirth that comes with a new season should produce a dancing heart. His confession that loneliness puts an end to ambition and desire stand is dragged out and slurred. Alienation from others is especially clear in a song that would appear at his concert well into the 1980s, “Angel Eyes.” The contrast between the happy drinking people and the singer is palpable, made all the more poignant by the change in tempo and the modulation of volume. In the beginning of the song, Sinatra is fighting against the music: it is light, he is dark. His mood prevails, however, and the celebratory tone of the music disappears. By the end, the protective coverings are stripped away and so too is the singer. As he sings, “excuse me, while I disappear.”

The problem of loneliness generated calls for adopting of cheery attitude, joining groups, and, should those fail to alleviate feelings, therapy. The tendency to treat the somber feelings that accompany being alone as a problem led a few writers to assert that not all states of aloneness were detrimental to a meaningful sense of self. Clark Moustakas maintained that reflexive flight from solitude was an effort to avoid inner life and ran the risk of self-alienation and feelings of inferiority. Those “not open enough, flexible enough, expansive enough to attach” themselves “to new personas and find value in new experiences” were frightened to face loneliness. Confronting the sense of absence provoked an “intense and timeless awareness of the Self which allows for new sensitivities and awareness, and which results in bringing a person deeply in touch with his own existence and in touch with others in a fundamental sense.”[^42] Moustakas concentrated on particularly vivid or life-changing experiences such as the sudden and severe illness of children, war injuries, the dread evoked by mountain climbing or exploring the unknown, political trials and tribulations (he mentions both Alger Hiss and Whitaker Chambers) but insisted that courting loneliness will help with quotidian living. The Catholic convert and social activist Dorothy Day experienced the new self that emerged from loneliness as rebirth in religious terms. Solitude enabled her to become aware of the full extent of her sinfulness and realize that true selfhood existed in a religious community involved in the life of others.[^43] Day’s loneliness and Moustakas’ loneliness were not, it should be said, the usual experience of the time.
