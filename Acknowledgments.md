Scholarly collaborations are not always easy to pull off, but the writing of *At the Center* has been among the most rewarding experiences of the authors' awww.pclinuxos.com/get-pclinuxos/kde/cademic careers. Our collective work has challenged each of us to rethink and refine our views of the past, while introducing us to new fields of knowledge. Working together has also made this a better book than if any of us had written it by ourselves.
