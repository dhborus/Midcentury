*I Confess* occupies an ambiguous place in director Alfred Hitchcock's canon. The film first appeared in 1953, part of the early Fifties productive run of films that included *Strangers on a Train*, *Dial M for Murder*, _Rear Window_, and *To Catch a Thief*. Hitchcock himself thought the film failed to achieve the tonal balances he wanted, lacking any humor. He further disliked some of his actors (although that was by no means unusual for him) and he took exception to the original script.

At bottom, Hitchcock thought the film too dependent on a Catholic sensibility and even told his famous interlocutor, Francois Truffaut, that "we shouldn't have made the picture."

Others see the film  as a noble failure -- one of a series of Hitchcockian efforts in which the reach exceeded the grasp, in which the premise, in other words, was not fully realized. For such critics, such as Dave Kehr of the *Chicago Reader*, such exercises are rehearsals for later masterpieces.

Still others,  particularly those of the *Cahiers du Cinema* circle, regard *I Confess* as an under-appreciated classic, significant for its intense and smoldering portrayal of the main character's moral struggle.

Although much of the action of *I Confess* is situated in the legal system of French Quebec, the drama is less a matter of the court's verdict than the internal torment of the lead character, Catholic priest Michael Logan, played with characteristic intensity by Montgomery Clift, who was then fresh off his triumph in *A Place in the Sun*.

Since the basic outlines of Logan's conflict appear in the first fifteen minutes or so of the film, it is no violation of the "No Spoiler" rule to say that *I Confess* turns on Logan's hearing a confession from the church's caretaker admitting that he murdered a man in the course of a robbery. As luck would have it, the victim was the very man who was blackmailing Father Michael over a love affair that Logan had prior to his entering the priesthood. (An aside--one complaint of critics is that it remains unclear exactly how subject to blackmail the priest would be for such amorous activity prior to taking his vow of celibacy -- a vow that Father Michael did not violate when a priest)

Subsequent reels rehearse the "wrong man" motif that dominated Hitchcock's films of the period as Logan increasingly falls under the suspicion of a vengeful detective played by Karl Malden. But because he is obligated to God to adhere to the seal of the confession, Father Michael can not actively clear his name by revealing what he knows. In short, the guilt permeates the man who receives the confession, not the one who gave it.

Technically, of course, Quebec law wouldn't have allowed into evidence anything that Father Michael learned from confession anyway, but because we know who committed the crime, the suspense of the film resides in whether Logan will pay with his life for keeping silent.

Yes, there are twists and turns -- it is a Hitchcock movie after all. And there is the great atmosphere of Quebec City and some masterful moments of composition with light and dark tones, but in the end *I Confess* succeeds or fails on how poignant and believable we find Logan's very Catholic dilemma between self preservation and the sacred duty that requires him to be an accessory after the fact.

The Jesuit-trained Hitchcock concluded that Logan's dilemma did not resonate with non-Catholics, who simply wanted hin to break the seal of the confession. And, apparently, he had a point. I just read a Hindu critic, Manish Mathur,  who found Logan a frustrating and unsatisfying character for this reason, but did admit that once he granted the premise he appreciated the tension between self preservation and obligation.

Those who love the smoldering forward-moving tension -- underscored by the constant walking throughout the film -- point to Montgomery Clift's portrayal as clinching the deal. Clift was a method actor -- the theory of acting then popular that emphasized the need for discovery of true (i.e. internal unconscious) motivation that justified character action. So much so that his acting coach Mira Rospova was constantly on set with him, often standing behind the director nodding approval.

Method acting is much mocked these days for its pretension -- and one certainly can't imagine Hitchcock, who famously referred to actors as cattle, having much tolerance for it.

Indeed at one point he needed Clift to look up at a building as he crossed the street. The actor originally demurred, saying he needed to considered whether Father Michael would indeed look up at that moment rather than at the crowd that had gathered during his trial.

Hitchcock didn't care what Clift thought-- he needed him to look up at that precise moment or everything leading up to and from that glance would not make sense. Clift looked up.

Such moments notwithstanding, champions of the film are particularly enamored of Clift's performance, contending that he displays â€œan air of total dignity at all times and only through his eyes that we sense his bewilderment at all the things that are happening to him.""

Hitchcock may have thought that the religious and ethnic particularity of the film limited its aesthetic and final success, and much of its style and tone will strike us today as outdated and perhaps even overly wrought. Nevertheless, the film can also serve as a reminder to us that there are legitimate and meaningful motives that clash with those of self-preservation and self-interest.
