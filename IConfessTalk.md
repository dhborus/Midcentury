*I Confess* occupies an ambiguous place in director Alfred Hitchcock's canon. The film first appeared in 1953, part of the early Fifties productive run of films that included *Strangers on a Train*, *Dial M for Murder*, _Rear Window_, and *To Catch a Thief*. For European critics, particularly those of the *Cahiers du Cinema* circle, *I Confess* is an under-appreciated classic, significant for its intense and smoldering portray of the transference of guilt and an inner turmoil.

For such critics, the film owes much not only to Hitchcock's genius but also to the mesmerizing portrayal of the lead character, Father Michael Logan, by Montgomery Clift.

Clift, then fresh off his triumph in *A Place in the Sun* captured the torment of a priest bound by the seal of the confession that allowed him to know who murdered the man who was in fact blackmailing Father Michael for acts committed before Michael chose the priesthood.

Normally one would say "Spoiler Alert" but what I've revealed so far happens in the first fifteen minutes of the film. The bulk of the film is the playing out of the tension as Logan falls increasingly under suspicion for the crime yet his obligation to God prevents him from revealing what he knows. For Francois Truffaut, the premise works because Clift  displays “an air of total dignity at all times. . . only through his eyes that we sense his bewilderment at all the things that are happening to him.


Hitchcock, on the other hand, was less enthusiastic — confessing to his interlocutor Francois Truffaut that the film never achieved the tone that he thought ideal and that, in fact, it shouldn’t have been made.
