*I Confess* occupies an ambiguous place in director Alfred Hitchcock's canon. The film first appeared in 1953, part of the early Fifties productive run of films that included *Strangers on a Train*, *Dial M for Murder*, _Rear Window_, and *To Catch a Thief*. Hitchcock thought the film failed to achieve the tonal balances he wanted, disliked some of his actors (although that was by no means unusual for him) and took exception to the original script. Given the dependence of the film on audiences understanding a Catholic view of obligation to God, the Jesuit - trained Hitchcock even went so far as to tell his interlocutor, Francois Truffaut, that "we shouldn't have made the picture."

For European critics, however,  particularly those of the *Cahiers du Cinema* circle, *I Confess* is an under-appreciated classic, significant for its intense and smoldering portrayal of the transference of guilt and an inner turmoil.

Although much of *I Confess* is situated in the legal system of French Quebec, the drama is less a matter of the court's verdict than the internal torment of the lead character, Father Michael Logan, played by Montgomery Clift, who was then fresh off his triumph in *A Place in the Sun*.

Since the basic outlines of Logan's conflict appear in the first fifteen minutes or so of the film, it is no violation of the "No Spoiler" rule to say that *I Confess* turns on Logan hearing a confession from the church's caretaker admitting that he murdered in the course of a robbery the very man who was blackmailing Logan over a love affair that Logan had prior to his entering the priesthood.

As the film proceeds, Father Michael increasingly falls under suspicion of the detective played by Karl Malden. Yet, given his obligation to God and the seal of the confessional, he can not actively clear his name. Technically, of course, Quebec law wouldn't allow into evidence anything he'd utter from what he learned in the confessional, but whether he could keep his vow under the pressure of his life itself is the drama here -- and the success or failure of the film rests on how much we believe the dilemma.

It was this that Hitchcock claimed that non-Catholics could make no sense of. I just read a Hindu critic, who praised the film but concluded that he simply had to accept the premise, even though it made no sense to him.

Those who love the smoldering forward-moving tension -- underscored by the constant walking throughout the film -- point to Montgomery Clift's portrayal as clinching the deal. Clift was a method actor -- the theory of acting then popular that emphasized the need for discovery of true (i.e. internal unconscious) motivation that justified character action. So much so that his acting coach Mira Rospova was constantly on set with him, often standing behind the director nodding approval.

Method acting is much mocked these days for its pretension -- and one certainly can't imagine Hitchcock, who famously referred to actors as cattle, having much tolerance for it.

At one point he needed Clift to look up at a building as he crossed the street. The actor originally demurred, saying he needed to considered whether Father Michael would indeed look up at that moment rather than at the crowd that had gathered during his trial.

Hitchcock didn't care what Clift thought-- he needed him to look up at that precise moment or everything leading up to and from that glance would not make sense. Clift looked up.

Clift sells the premise, champions of the film contend, because method or no, he displays â€œan air of total dignity at all times and only through his eyes that we sense his bewilderment at all the things that are happening to him.
