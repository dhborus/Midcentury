*I Confess* occupies an ambiguous place in director Alfred Hitchcock's canon. The film first appeared in 1953, part of the early Fifties productive run of films that included *Strangers on a Train*, *Dial M for Murder*, _Rear Window_, and *To Catch a Thief*. For European critics, particularly those of the *Cahiers du Cinema* circle, *I Confess* is an under-appreciated classic, significant for its intense and smoldering portray of the transference of guilt and an inner turmoil.

For such critics, the film owes much not only to Hitchcock's genius but to the stunning portrayal of the lead character, Father Michael Logan, by Montgomery Clift. 

Hitchcock, on the other hand, was less enthusiastic — confessing to his interlocutor Francois Truffaut that the film never achieved the tone that he thought ideal and that, in fact, it shouldn’t have been made. *Jacob*
