Running on empty.[Ugh. Zettler is really slow and less easy to use than Atom. See  @wilmer2008, p. 76]


-- autocomplete.bibtex works on .md files. But has problems setting up after closing. Not sure particularly how to fix. Returning seems particularly idiosyncratic.

-- Git Hub sometimes does not register changes. Not sure why. Close pane and then control-shift-9

Important to work with notes and projects properly.
