Running on empty.


-- autocomplete.bibtex works on .md files. But has problems setting up after closing. Not sure particularly how to fix. Returning seems particularly idiosyncratic. Can, of course, use the Ulysses method to cite. It is a bit slower and requires Zotero to be open.

--Does seem to help getting acb to work by exporting Zotero library.

--Zettlr is slow and problematic in the use of pandoc inside the app.

-- Git Hub sometimes does not register changes. Not sure why. Close pane and then control-shift-9

Important to work with notes and projects properly.
