### Atom problems


1. Use of terminal from within Atom. (probably won't solve) -- can use DocDown
2. Thesaurus use -- important
3. Setting up nvAtom done (not that difficult--just converts Dropbox directory to searchable database)
4. Setting up Awiki.

### Pandoc and Markdown Questions

- Learn codes for open file, smart printing. And so on. Did learn that I can use pandoc to change docx to pdf. Want to know how to use smart typography, and open newly minted file.

- Learn how to add extra lines in Markdown. Solution: \s (where s stands for a space)



### Main Computer Question


-- Drop, at least for the moment, autocomplete.bibtex . Works inconsistently.

-- Do not need Zettlr, except maybe as a note taker. Only has one pane and does not need a secon (third, really) plain text editor.

Even though the iMac can be slow, it is eye-friendly. Which is a boon these days. The Macbook is fairly slow. Can use it for mobile writing at the library or JCC, but it really isn't a permanent machine. Probably no need to update to the next operating system.

The iPad can be a mobile solution maybe for note-taking or some light editing. I suppose I could try Ulysses as a backup. Or for Chapters Four and Five.

Was even going to try going Ulysses, but then got notice about Ulysses 15 that did not mention dual pane or . . . acknowledge a delay. So Atom (and Ulysses cancel)

Oh -- and redo bibliography by reducing items to working on projects.
