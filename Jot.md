### Atom problems


1. Use of terminal from within Atom. (probably won't solve) -- can use DocDown
2. Thesaurus use -- important
3. Setting up nvAtom @done (not that difficult--just converts Dropbox directory to searchable database)
4. Setting up Awiki


### Main Computer Question


-- autocomplete.bibtex works on .md files. But has problems setting up after closing. Not sure particularly how to fix. Returning seems particularly idiosyncratic. Can, of course, use the Ulysses method to cite. It is a bit slower and requires Zotero to be open.

--Does seem to help getting acb to work by exporting Zotero library.

--Zettlr is slow and problematic in the use of pandoc inside the app. Offers only one file at a time.

-- Git Hub sometimes does not register changes. Not sure why. Close pane and then control-shift-9


Important to work with notes and projects properly.

--Big question-- which machine should be the main writing device? Which machine, in other words, is the most comfortable writing environment?

- iMac seems slower than one would hope.[@aaron1977, p.55]

- iMac gives all kinds of real estate. That is both helpful--full view of writing and notes  
- -- and not -- Ulysses seems ill-suited for so much space (might well change with new dual pane mode)

- MacBook is getting on in years -- although with Zotero and Atom or Ulysses, not much asked of it. Still probably won't go on much longer when new OS comes around. (Of course, no need to upgrade)

- MacBook gives mobility. Which is important just to get out of the house. Issue is whether it should be the main machine.

- iMac has info that might be needed in the short term -- and the programs.[@boris1986. p. 35]

- division of tasks: iMac at home; laptop/iPad mobile makes sense. Ulysses and plain text perfectly suited for tasks.[@boris1986. p. 55]


### Pandoc and Markdown Questions

- Learn codes for open file, smart printing. And so on. Did learn that I can use pandoc to change docx to pdf. Want to know how to use smart typography, and open newly minted file.   

- Learn how to add extra lines in Markdown. Solution: \s (where s stands for a space)
