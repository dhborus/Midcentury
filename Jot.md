# Chapter Four:

### The Decentered Search for the Centered Self

Looking back on his decision to light out suddenly for Europe, the narrator-protagonist of James Baldwin's _Giovanni's Room_ (1956), David, muses that he most likely did so because, "as we say in America, I wanted to find myself." The phrase, he adds, does not appear "in the language of any other people." It "certainly does not mean what it says but betrays a nagging suspicion that something has been misplaced." The sojourn does little to held David resolve his confusion, especially his uncertainty about his sexual orientation. Vacillating between homosexual and heterosxual romances, David possesses no firm sense of who he is and whom he desires. He is engaged to be married yet seems to truly love (or at least passionately desire) the title character, a bartender at a gay bar in Paris who kills the owner over the latter’s refusal to rehire him. Wracked by guilt on the day of Giovanni’s execution, David admits that in the end he still has the “same self from which I had spent so much time in flight.”[^1]

The book’s lukewarm reception owed much to Baldwin’s matter-of-fact handling of homosexuality and his refusal to confine his writing to “black” subjects. His insight that the quest for stable sense of identity constituted a central concern of American cultural life, however, was very much on point.[^2] Individuals had, of course, long pondered the question who they were, but, in light of Cold War era worries about the deleterious effects of an impersonal and bureaucratic society, the search for self assumed a special importance after the war. Much art and social science took as its subject efforts to find oneself in a society in which traditional attachments and relationships were attenuated or non-existent but which had no meaningful alternatives. Where once the paths to authentic and valid selfhood were understood to come about in the normal course of living, the transformation of and pitfalls within American life made attaining a coherent self that knew its capabilities and was capable of launching significant projects a problem, a task requiring special effort and for which there were few viable guidelines. Many social analysts worried that the failure to complete the task successfully left a large portion of the American people uprooted and anxious underneath an often placid exterior.

The self in the postwar era was not only a cultural problem. It was also a political problem. A new form of analysis, one we might call psychosocial, achieved prominence in the middle third of the twentieth century, arguing in effect that political health depended on the psychic health of the populace. Such works as Erich Fromm’s _Escape From Freedom_ (1941), Theodor Adorno’s _Authoritarian Personality_ (1950), and Hannah Arendt’s _Origins of Totalitarianism_ (1951) attributed mass intolerance and antidemocratic movements to psychosocial disarray. Totalitarianism thus succeeded less by meeting material needs than by manipulating unfulfilled psychological ones. Although the ideologies of fascism and communism had little actual support, many commentators nonetheless worried that a society of anomic individuals who lacked internalized standards were fodder for poseurs and demagogues. That possibility no doubt fanned an interest in Tocqueville’s argument that democracy produced citizens who sought safety in a culture of stifling uniformity and were capable of massing against those who were distinctive.

 Contemporary psychology experiments seemed to confirm inclinations toward conformity. The work of both Solomon Asch (1956) and Stanley Milgram (1963) was much cited as warning signals that individuals lacked the psychological assuredness to resist a relentless majority. Asch demonstrated that college students would change their view of which of two lines was longest when others in the group disagreed. Milgram instructed study participants to apply electric shocks when “learners” seated in another room delivered wrong answers. Participants did not know that the “learners” were confederates or that the shocks were not actually administered. Despite initial reluctance, most participants continued to “shock” when ordered to do so by figures displaying symbols of authority (white lab coats, clipboard), even when the “learners” let out loud screams.[@asch1951; @asch1956; @milgram1963] There was, some observers concluded, a “Good German” and a torturer within all of us.
