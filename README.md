Files for At the Center

I was born in St. Louis, Missouri in October of 1951, educated at the University of Michigan and the University of Virginia. 

I have taught at Lehman College, Colgate University, and the University of Rochester.

I have written on the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, particularly its intellectual history.
