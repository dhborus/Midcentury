1. Will need to rework Introduction to stress again the confusions of the self and the drive to posit a stable and predictable one.
2. Will need to rewrite the body Introduction
3. Eventually the Freud - neo Freud sections need review.
4. Some way to do less on this one and this one and this one in the teen age section.
5. Emphasize the issue of loneliness as reworking whether society was too little or too much present. Touched upon the relationship of modernity and the self, of course.
5. And, of course, delineate paragraphs, unless I go with Ulysses. Probably won't, although it would be nice to try Zettlr or Atom.[@beth2011]

### Computer process

--Although I should have opted for a laptop, iMac as regular machine makes sense. Ubuntu does not. Terrible for batteries. -- iPad is not really a work machine. Might work with Ulysses.[@rosenberg1992, p. 44]

### Atom problems

1. Misspellings do not show up immediately.
2. Use of terminal from within Atom.
3. Thesaurus use -- important[@rauchway2005, p. 36]
4. Understanding panels. For awhile, far too busy.
5. Need to get autocomplete bibliography to work.
6. nvAtom
7. Awiki
8. Pandoc-converter
