## Tasks

1. Will need to rework Introduction to stress again the confusions of the self and the drive to posit a stable and predictable one.
2. Will need to rewrite the body Introduction
3. Eventually the Freud - neo Freud sections need review.
4. Some way to do less on this one and this one and this one in the teen age section.
5. Emphasize the issue of loneliness as reworking whether society was too little or too much present. Touched upon the relationship of modernity and the self, of course.
5. And, of course, delineate paragraphs.[@hardison1989, pp. 44-99.]

### Computer process

Convinced on plain text advantages. Can use Ubuntu on MacBook and work with Atom, which I am increasingly impressed by. Can use Ulysses for an iPad mobile exchange with the iMac.

Pretty cool. Can put off the purchase of an advanced laptop.

Notes, of course, in plain text. put them in a folder under the project. One for Draft, one for Notes, one for bibliography, one for planning/outline and so forth.

Think I can easily transfer between Atom and Ulysses. Again Pandoc is a marvellous program.
