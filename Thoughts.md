Popular understandings of the 1950s have tended to portray the decade as one that insisted upon bodily modesty and restraint and rigid gender roles. At the same time prevailing cultural norms preached the social dangers of unbridled sexuality, it also took as granted that biology proscribed inclinations and potentials and therefore fit men and women for distinct and mutually exclusive roles. There is, of course, abundant evidence of this biologically inflected view of the self, but but it is salutary to remember that there were other tendencies as well. The same society that lauded propriety also celebrated authenticity and naturalness. Freudians, after all, warned of the dangers of repression, which led to psychic damage and in any event bound to fail. Talk of propriety and restraint did not prevent considerably more explicit public display than had been common in the first half of the century. Criticism notwithstanding, the sexualized performances of Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe occasioned relatively little effective censure and served for many as gender ideals. Private behavior was also considerably more complicated than the typical view of the era would have it. The immediate postwar years witnessed dramatic increases in premarital conception and single motherhood. Ideas about the body and its inclinations, then, were far from uniform and the uncertainties raised once again the degree to which the self was an ethereal or embodied entity.[@miller1977, p. 100-33.]
