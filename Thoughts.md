## Tasks

1. Will need to rework Introduction to stress again the confusions of the self and the drive to posit a stable and predictable one.
2. Will need to rewrite the body Introduction
3. Eventually the Freud - neo Freud sections need review.
4. Some way to do less on this one and this one and this one in the teen age section.
5. Emphasize the issue of loneliness as reworking whether society was too little or too much present. Touched upon the relationship of modernity and the self, of course.
5. And, of course, delineate paragraphs, unless I go with Ulysses.

### Computer process

Might be best served here by finishing in Ulysses (Ipad and iMac) and doing Dreams/Consultants in Atom.

Have converted the MacBook to Ubuntu and the trackpad is . . . eh (frozen twice in two days). Might try mouse, although that is bulky, or a different distro.
Worse the battery drains even faster in Ubuntu -- probably best to get a cheap laptop and go with that. Might try another distro.

### Atom problems

1. Misspellings do not show up immediately.
2. Use of terminal from within Atom.
3. Thesaurus use -- important
4. Understanding panels. For awhile, far too busy.
5. Possible packages.
6. nvAtom
7. Awiki
8. Pandoc-converter
