Thank you for the opportunity to read the first-rate manuscript, _At the Center: American Thought and Culture in the Mid-Twentieth Century, 1948-1963_. It brings the series to a distinguished conclusion.

First I will offer some general observations about the Ms., before going into some chapter-by-chapter comments. My chapter-by-chapter comments are meant to be suggestions rather than edicts for revision.

Finding a theme for a book covering almost any swatch of time is difficult and confounding. _At the Center_ works well, in general, since it is given a couple of related meanings. The key is to return regularly, but not too often to the theme. In addition, contrary themes must not be neglected. On this level, the book succeeds quite nicely. In a couple of chapters, however, I think some tinkering might work to keep the reader docked in the bay of the concept.

The authors are to be congratulated strongly for the scope of their work, and for introducing a host of figures – especially African-American and women intellectuals. Although I am supposed to be an expert in this area, the names of Betty Bao Lord, George McTurnan Kahin, for example, were new to me.

The manuscript is smart overall, deeply engaged with ideas – exactly what the series demands. I do think that some changes would help the manuscript. First, perhaps in the Introduction or Conclusion, might the authors confront counter-interpretations a bit more fully. For instance, they discuss rather well the notion of Universalism, the Human Condition, etc. But they do not grapple with Grief’s criticisms of it. Ditto, when mentioning the importance of Abstract Expressionism later in the book, might the authors deal with its highly debated role as an arm of American Cold War policy? I know from the bibliography that the authors are well aware of such controversies, but if included in the book, they might make for some large questions to percolate in the minds of readers.

There are stylistic differences between some of the chapters. The Introduction, Chapters 1, 4. 7 tended to be more dense than others in the book, both in terms of style and content. While these chapters often had good topic sentences, the material in the paragraph sometimes veered away, making for some confusion. Sometimes, too, the tidal wave of names proved overwhelming, and, I think, unnecessary. A bit of editing would be welcome to make the excellence of these chapters more apparent and accessible to students.

One other problem, easily solved, is repetition. Perhaps because there are three separate authors, a number of times figures considered earlier reappear in later chapters. This is not necessarily problematic, so long as stuff is not repeated from earlier. In my comments on particular chapters, I will point out a few occasions when I found this unnecessary.

Of course, all books in the series need to go their own way, in terms of what is covered – and what is neglected. I do wish, I must say that the authors had discussed the rise of Jewish novelists in the postwar period (after all, it would link to many of the themes in the book). I also would have liked to see some discussion of this period of High Modernism, especially in Architecture.

**Introduction:** This is a strong introduction in terms of dealing with the complexity of the organizing ideas for the book. But it is not welcoming to readers since it is, to my mind, written in a dense style, sometimes overwhelming with its range and content. A problem with the Introduction, as I recall, and with Ch.1 is the tendency to quote historians, sometimes at length. It would work much better if the author of these chapters paraphrased such arguments. This becomes less of a problem in later chapters, when a particularly pithy phrase from the historian is employed, rather than a few, often difficult sentences.

Maybe a bit more here on the ambiguity, the push and pull of opposing forces in this period. Here, and especially in the text, I thought that the issue of nuclear annihilation and its relation to themes and artistic creations in this period might have been explicated more fully. The topic sentences in the introduction generally do nice work.

Apropos of above, I thought that the discussion of Dower was unnecessary and distracting.
Drop Katznelson. That paragraph could be clearer. Same for material on Marty.
Why not have Herberg as an accessible way to deal with the non-sectarian nature of religion in this period?
Modernity, as with some other terms (i.e. hegemony later) definitely need fleshing out for readers.
Does discussion of Auden’s views work here?
Nice how context for period is weaved into text.

**Ch. 1: American Hegemony and the New Cosmopolitanism**
21. Revise sentence “Luce’s dramatic . . .”
  “Dynamic Center” works well. Relate now to “Vital Center”?
23. Nice about embrace of center and its strength, but consensus never absolute.
25. Revise sentence so it is clear that Clare Booth Luce was condemning Wallace rather than her husband.
  Kluckhohn v. Luce and issued of “orchestrated heterogeneity.” (not sure about why I am writing this, but I noted it at the time. Sorry)
28. Dates for Kennan’s telegram and article.
40. A long list of figures. Most will have no idea who are Voorhis, Cranston, etc. except old men like me.
41. Too much happening in Paragraph. Opens with Teahouse, then Heller, Vonnegut. Needs more explanation and linkage, I think. What of Mailer, mentioned earlier. Doesn’t he belong in this group of WW II writers. Ditto John Horne Burns.
43. No generalization possible for émigrés? More cosmopolitan and sophisticated, tied to a deep pessimism. Connect here with Holocaust and Nuclear Annihilation as well as consumerism.
In any case, separate paragraphs would be welcomed here. Or drop UNESCO discussion.
44. Not clear how this group of emigres differed from ones discussed in previous pages.
This really is a bravura chapter, although overwhelming at the same time. Perhaps a bit more focus on fewer figures, with some biography as was done in the section on Kluckhohn?

**Chapter Two: Inventing America, Again**
As per last comment, this chapter approaches things with a lighter touch, focused on individuals and thought which is, I think, more accessible to readers.
52. Finish with Matthiessen, then go on to Smith or Marx. Or better yet, drop reference to them.
  You will return to Matthiessen later, but would it work to finish him here, making note of his homosexuality and suicide?
  Might this discussion include the Cold War notion of American destiny related to Puritan ideal of “A City Upon a Hill”?
58. Stearns mentioned earlier.
58. Kazin was also, in many ways, creating a tradition. Melville’s inclusion in the canon did not wait fully until this period. Link Lerner to your key concepts of consensus and centering.
64. Ellison also opposed view of African-American culture as damaged. Instead, he focused on its vitality.
64. Do we need so much of Tocqueville, especially at this point?
67. At last, a return to “centering.”
 Good on women but what of the competing images in this period?
70. Adam’s Rib, I believe, was mentioned earlier. Might one reference be dropped?
72. Give more sense of the full thrust of anti-communist purges, including gays?
74. Now Riesman appears, but he was promised earlier.
76. Discuss here how Consensus is connected with “vital center” and centering.
77. As noted, unsure if returning to Matthiessen works.
78. Ditto. Canon Building wasn’t the essence of American Renaissance. It was, in many ways, part of the New Criticism, with emphasis on style and mechanics. Some repetition with earlier discussion. Matthiessen resurfaces on p. 94. He was about style more than content.
81. Kazin reappears. Kazin as a Jew is important. Recall that famous retort to him, “What do you mean “our forests, Alfred?” Has flux now replaced centering as key theme?
84. Circling back, again to “Our Country.” Mailer’s dissent should be registered. Why not, instead, include the _Partisan Review_ symposium on Religion (I forget date). Relate to Herberg and centering of religion? What of Native American spiritualism and myth school, as developed by Leja and Belgrad? This fits in with early Abstract Expressionists.
Good that C.L.R. James receives attention.

**Chapter Three: History and Anti-Historicism**
98. Opens with French existentialism, which is fine, but returns to it later. Might it be noted that the philosophy, and its explication, was particularly open to women? Now or later. I think fewer names at outset would work better.
Could be clearer about how historicity is related to Centering, anti-historicism . . .
101. _To The Finland Station_ was published in 1940, not 1937.
102-03. What about including Hook on Hegel and Marx?
There is a difference between the early and later pages  of _Axel’s Castle_, demonstrating Wilson’s dropping of aestheticism for engagement. His embrace of Marxism did not long outlast publication of _Finland_. Was Wilson a historicist?
107. Good on Arendt.
111. Reads almost as if Camus got it from Bell.
112f. Wasn’t Macdonald discussed earlier, albeit briefly.
115. Universalism, so vague as to be problematic, even repressive? Link with Grief?
116. Plenty of Popper. Well done, too. But he was not an American thinker.
118. Deal more, then, with Quine? Link him, perhaps, with Nelson Goodman.
120. Yes, but “the view from nowhere” might suggest possible stance of objectivity. Connects with New Critics stance about texts?
121. Niebuhr connects with Camus in opposition to ideologies. Relate to _The Rebel_?
122. Boom-time for religion and its institutions. Yes, but isn’t there a shift occurring, with the rise of evangelical churches? Billy Graham and company. Again, this seems an appropriate place for Mr. Herberg.
124. “Stream of Camp literature.” More of a trickle, at least according to Novick. Discussion of Arendt on issue of Eichmann and “Banality of Evil”?
124. Weren’t Beats mentioned in previous chapter?
124. Excellent on Suzuki and Centering here.
127. Opened with Existentialism, finally returning to it.
129. Freud was absolutely central to American thought in 1950s. More on this, as per Nathan Hale.
131. Excellent on “New Conservatives.” Include Eastman? Nice to see Peter Vierick included.
But on p. 134, he is found not as “learned and eloquent” as Weaver. Well, I beg to differ.

**Chapter Four: The Search for a Centered Self**
Nice to add Asch to Milgram, takes it away from the over-done.
<!-- 148. Ah, Freud again. What about the discover of TEENS as a new category and implications for consumerism in this period? Sheldon discussion is excellent, but unclear to me why, exactly, his ideas were racist.
151. I didn’t know Montagu was Jewish.
157. Separate paragraph for critique of Mead.
158. Freud and Marx (Fromm), link with Marcuse (ah, does later)
160. Explain “repressive desublimation”

161. Riesman was discussed in Chap. 1.
163. What of Riesman’s link with Arendt? _Time_ focus in that article, as I recall, was on how well-adjusted and social Reisman was.
164. Autonomous individual lament, link with teens, _Rebel without a Cause_?
167. Beats. Rebellion, yes, but how also fit into period, as with their sexism.
168. Back to existentialism! -->
<!-- 171. A quote from Port Huron or _Liberation_ to drive home point. -->
<!-- 172. Frank did have a logic to organization of his images. And, compared to other photographers, he was especially drawn to black Americans. -->
<!-- 172. Great on Tooker, too. Relate him to Hopper? -->
<!-- 175. Better opening for the paragraph. Too much happening. Sinatra’s _In the Wee Small Hours_ is central. Unclear how Ricky and rock relate. -->

179. Ah, “the young and the restless,” good. But what of cloud of nuclear annihilation that hangs over this generation?

183. Anti-Momism as widespread. What of Wylie and others.

184. A bit more on Goodman before moving to Friedan. Relate to Erickson’s idea of a moratorium period? Statistics on women for this period, in relation to Elaine May’s ideas? Ditto to demographics on teens and consumerism?

**Chapter Five: American Inclusion and Its Discontents”** [Decide what to do about Friedan and analysis]

195. Family of man as universalism and humanity redivivus. Place in face of nuclear holocaust fear. Offerings in the show were quite varied, included a number of early Robert Franks. Yes, about American diversity as linked with freedom. This would apply to Cold War notion of painting – different styles expresses American freedom.
198. Connect Pluralism with counter-veiling powers thesis before going into Labor?
Decline of class. Link with Americanization, rise of suburbs?
Working-class assimilation. Once again, another spot for Herberg.
Rise of evangelicals. Better on p.84?
209. Odd time for Herberg to appear, finally. Struggle for inclusion in films, perhaps? Repeat appearance for Myrdal.
212. Unsure how Gottschalk and Jewish author belong in this paragraph.
214. Jews, too, in baseball, i.e. Hank Greenberg.
214. Clark’s “purported to show.” Didn’t they?
223. Hansberry will reappear later.
227. Was Friedan’s plea for “common humanity” as weak as that of The Family of Man, or of Stampp?
232f. Excellent on gays.
238. Hard on Lieber and Stoller. Mention that they were Jewish, urban hipsters.
245. Enclose “backbeat you can’t lose” in quotation marks.
I think this chapter can use a better conclusion.

**Chapter Six: Modern Enactments”**
Might we open with a definition for modernism. I know, I know, an immense challenge, but . . .
247. Frost a modernist?
249. Unclear about reference to _Swan’s Way._
Excellent on Pollock. Comes alive.
250. Paraphrase of drop quotes from Varnedoe and Clark. Thought Rosenberg might come in here rather than later in chapter. Separate paragraph on Rosenberg when he appears later.
255. Return discussion of Greenberg’s idea of progress in art to discussion of this issue in the introduction.
256. Discuss the allure of the primitive in this period?
257. Might this be the place to link with Cage and Happening at Black Mountain, rather than later? Just wondering. Excellent on Kaprow.
259. The method of close reading, by New Critics, was dealt with earlier. Unclear to me, in any case, how well it follows discussion of Abstract Expressionists.
259. Theme of centering seems to have been lost. Return to it, if possible. Also, issue of Cold War appropriation of art. Issue of battle over Representational art.
265. Intense feeling related to primitivism, spontaneity theme in Belgrad, linked with Ab. Ex.
268f. Excellent on Asawa and Albers.
278. Introduction of The Club seems abrupt here. Link earlier with Ab. Exp?
Discussion of melding of various arts within a single work as a style of Centering?
286. City life – relate, for instance, to poetry of Frank O’Hara?

**Chapter Seven: Thinking Globally**
I think that this chapter was agog with insight and range. Having said that, I thought it lost sight of the theme of centering. Do we need, for example, discussion of the various Area Studies programs? I wondered if the gist of the early pages could be fitted into chapter 1.
303. Caroline not Carolyn Ware.
306. I think a fuller discussion of Herman Kahn would be welcome.
309. Niebuhr AGAIN?!
309. Ah, centering enters the picture.
312. Unsure how comedy in this period relates to “thinking globally.”
Then the Arms Race?
315. This material on international conferences, decolonialization, etc. might link more closely with opening of chapter on Area Studies? Some repetition.
1963: “History was open again,” “both promising and treacherous.” Nice phrases.
**Chapter Eight: “A Phase Change”**

Material with Le Goff was fascinating to me. Unsure how student reader would engage it.
1962 was a keynote year for challenges to assumptions. Might Thomas Szasz’s attack on psychology merit inclusion here? Good illustration would be to discuss novel, _One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest_.
332. Not sure if the section on Belafonte and Robeson works.
332. Hansberry, again. Simone is good.
Juxtapose Jones with Murray. Highlight his movement away from Beats and center of racial inter-connections?
Excellent on jazz. Discuss how focus on improvisation can still be fitted into a notion of the whole, as related to key concept of centering?
Baldwin, again?!

The conclusion seems abrupt here. Why not push idea that by 1962 it was clear that the center would no longer hold, for a host of reasons, so you get this shift in emphasis. Pushing of the envelope in American culture, or my notion of excess? End with how Warhol, for instance, marks such a break with Abstract Expressionists and Modernism? Just a suggestion. Or with the Port Huron statement.

Conclusion to conclusion seemed abrupt to me.
