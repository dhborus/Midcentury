critique Baldwin's unapologetic treatment of homosexuality and his refusal to confine his writing to "black" subjects resulted in the book's lukewarm reception. His insight that postwar America was haunted by the search for stable selves, however, was quite on point. Care of the self was, of course, a long-standing preoccupation of American culture but it had usually taken the form of tending to the soul. American religion was hardly less important in a postwar era that prominently featured Reinhold Niebuhr, Billy Graham, and Abraham Joshua Heschel. It was joined and sometimes intertwined with a new emphasis on the psyche. Many factors accounted for the


Where once the paths to authentic and valid selfhood were understood to come about in the normal course of living, the transformation of and pitfalls within American life made attaining a coherent self that knew its capabilities and was capable of launching significant projects a problem, a task requiring special effort and for which there were few viable guidelines. Many social analysts worried that the failure to complete the task successfully left a large portion of the American people uprooted and anxious underneath an often placid exterior.

The worries were not simply cultural but political

[^2]: Technically speaking, self and identity demarcate entities. Self is a reflection on and reference by an individual to him or herself. Identity is the condition of having a unique existence. In philosophy, identity relates to sameness across time. In practice, however, the terms have demonstrated a good deal of slippage so that continuity of self---constant awareness of the continuity of oneself---is taken in much literature as proof of coherent identity. See Gerald Izenberg, _Identity: The Necessity of a Modern Idea_ (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2016), 1-15.



 The importance of psychology to the effort to anchor the self made Sigmund Freud a crucial influence on American thought and culture. So prominent was he that the mass-market _Life_ magazine devoted a lengthy article to explaining his work and relevance to modern life.[^6] The Freudian unconscious was not, however, the only entry way Americans used to find themselves. For some, biology provided reassurance. Arguments that certain types of bodies bequeathed certain personalities were numerous. The search also appeared in wide-ranging debates over whether society was too much or too little present. For some, it pressed in so heavily that individuals could not achieve anything resembling authenticity. Others dissented, contending that the inability to connect with others was the cardinal condition of modern life. In many ways, the teenage years brought together both the somatic and social problems since that stage of life entailed both changing bodies and anxieties over popularity. Since the teenage years were also the time when individuals were, like Baldwin’s David, expected to find themselves, adolescence not surprisingly was the focus of intense interest and expectations. That adolescent selves (and by extension selves in general) found it extremely difficult to bear the burdens with which it was tasked only served to reinforce suspicions that the self was more fragile than it seemed.
