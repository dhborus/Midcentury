#  Chapter Four:

### The Decentered Search for the Centered Self
\
\
Just before he lights out for Europe, the narrator-protagonist of James Baldwin’s *Giovanni’s Room* (1956), David, muses that he did so because he “wanted to find myself.” He regards that desire as peculiarly American, noting that the phrase is neither current “in the language of any other people” and “certainly does not mean what it says but betrays a nagging suspicion that something has been misplaced.” The sojourn to the Old World does little to render David’s desires, inclinations, and capacities legible or stable. Unable to accept his homosexual longings, particularly for the titular character whom he abandons in the face of his conviction and execution for murder, David ends alienated from his very physical being, baffled when looking in the mirror by “what moves in this body” and for “what this body is searching.”[@baldwin1956a, p. 39, 189]

Contemporary critics found fault not only with the novel's unapologetic treatment of homosexuality but also its lack of coverage of black life and accused Baldwin of decadence and elitism. They missed, however, the central contention of Baldwin's fiction and nonfiction alike: the race problem originated in whites' inability to know themselves. Baldwin was only one of many artists and scholars who held that postwar American society made it difficult for Americans to develop a firm sense of who they were, allow consistent personal expression or reliably foster expanded capacities. As the leading exemplar of modernity, the United States was, the argument went, especially prone to psychic upheavals and fragmentation despite the often placid exterior of its citizens. Writing in 1962, the husband and wife team Mary and Eric Josephson laid blame for such psycho-social disorders as loss of self, anxiety states, despair, rootlessness, apathy, meaninglessness, and loss of beliefs and values on the absence of meaningful communities and interpersonal relations. Other commentators blamed corporate bureaucracy, advertising, and a wide array of institutional demands for conformity such as schools and the media. [@josephson1962. Popular contemporary criticisms of American life include John Keats, *The Crack in the Picture Window* (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1957); @packard1957; and @whyte1956. Two by Daniel Horowitz examine the genre: *Vance Packard & American Social Criticism* (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 1994) and *The Anxieties of Affluence: Critiques of American Consumer Culture, 1939-1979* (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 2004).]

Postwar concern about the insubstantiality of selves quickly assumed a political cast. Material and objective causes did not, most analysts contended, fully explanation popular support for Fascist and Communist regimes.  Mass intolerance and antidemocratic movements were best explained by psychosocial abnormalities. Erich Fromm's *Escape from Freedom* (1941), Theodor Adorno's *Authoritarian Personality* (1950), and Hannah Arendt's *Origin of Totalitarianism* all attributed totalitarian success to the ability of ruling groups to manipulate unfulfilled psychological needs. Although fascist and communist ideologies had little appeal to most Americans, many commentators nonetheless worried that a society of anomic individuals who lacked internalized standards were fodder for poseurs and demagogues. That possibility no doubt fanned an interest in Tocqueville's argument that democracy produced citizens who sought safety i a culture of stifling uniformity and who were capable of massing against those who were distinctive or different.[@mcclay1994 contains a useful summary of the tendency to explain political phenomena by psycho-social factors. It is noteworthy perhaps that all three were Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany. The philosopher Jacob Talmon, author of *The Origins of Totalitarian Democracy* (Boston: Beacon Press, 1952) might also be included in this group.] Augmenting the theoretical work of the social critics was that of social psychologists in a series of experiments Solomon Asch and Stanley Milgram obtained results that suggested most individuals lacked the psychological assuredness to resist a relentless majority or a demanding, unfeeling authority. Asch (1951, 1956) observed that subjects more often than not acceded to the group truth, even when it countered their own perceptions. For his part, Milgram discovered that most people would continue to punish others when ordered to do so. There was, many observers concluded a "Good German" in all of us.[The pertinent studies are @asch1951; @asch1956; and @milgram1963. For a discussion of the implications for the social psychology of postwar politics, see *Critical Psychology: An Introduction* (London: Sage, 1997) and Israel Charny, *Fascism and Democracy in the Human Mind: A Bridge between Mind and Society* (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2006)]

In meeting the growing weight of expectations placed on the self, Americans increasingly looked to psychological discourse or therapy rather than religion or philosophy, as would have been the case in the past. Where once Americans examined the state of their souls, their postwar counterparts more often than not turned their attention to their mental and emotional makeup. Emblematic of the shift was Rabbi Joshua Liebman's best-selling *Peace of Mind* (1947), which blended Talmudic wisdom with Freudian insight and a new popular advice literature, spearheaded by Ann Landers and Abigail Van Buren, that substituted psychological discernment for the old conduct of life bromides.[^5] Five times as many doctorates in psychology were awarded in the 1950s as the decade before. The number of psychiatrists increased ten fold from 1939 to 1959.[@scull2010]  Those numbers do not include the tremendous growth in psychological-based pastoral counseling. With numbers came a new prestige. Robert Linder’s *Fifty-Minute Hour* (1955) was indicative of the midcentury tendency to extol the psychiatrist as seer and depth psychology as the royal road to understanding motivation -- a tendency that informed a spate of movies ranging from Alfred Hitchcock's *Spellbound* (1945) to John Houston's *Freud* (1962). Small wonder, then, that *Life* Magazine hailed the 1950s as the "Age of Psychology."[^7]

Efforts in the "Age of Psychology" to find the foundations of a secure and stable self proceeded along a number of dimensions. Although Freud and Freudian discourse and therapies garnered great attention, they by no means had a monopoly. Personality testing, which gained great popularity in business and schools with its promise of matching people with jobs and mates with which they were best suited, owed much to Carl Jung's *Psychological Types* (1923).[The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator was the leading tool for categorizing and sorting people during the mid-twentieth century. @emre2018] For all the emphasis on thought, feeling, and inclination, biological determinism remained a crucial component of the search for a centered self. A number of investigators pinned their hopes on deciphering the somatic basis of selfhood. Others pondered the proper relationship between the self and others. At stake was whether society was too pressing on individuals or whether social bonds were too insubstantial and evanescent. The two concerns merged in one of the key worries of postwar American life, the nature of teenagers. A period of changing bodies and role testing, the teenage years proved fertile ground for theorists and artists alike.

**Body and Self**




Popular understandings of the 1950s have tended to portray the decade as one that insisted upon bodily modesty and restraint and rigid gender roles. At the same time prevailing cultural norms preached the social dangers of unbridled sexuality, it also took as granted that biology proscribed inclinations and potentials and therefore fit men and women for distinct and mutually exclusive roles. There is, of course, abundant evidence of this biologically inflected view of the self, but but it is salutary to remember that there were other tendencies as well. The same society that lauded propriety also celebrated authenticity and naturalness. Freudians, after all, warned of the dangers of repression, which led to psychic damage and in any event bound to fail. Talk of propriety and restraint did not prevent considerably more explicit public display than had been common in the first half of the century. Criticism notwithstanding, the sexualized performances of Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe occasioned relatively little effective censure and served for many as gender ideals. Private behavior was also considerably more complicated than the typical view of the era would have it. The immediate postwar years witnessed dramatic increases in premarital conception and single motherhood. Ideas about the body and its inclinations, then, were far from uniform and the uncertainties raised once again the degree to which the self was an ethereal or embodied entity.[^7]

Psychologist William Sheldon, whose work enjoyed its greatest popularity in the 1940s and 1950s, was insistent that the self was a function of body type. The godson of William James, Sheldon drew upon post-Mendelian modern genetics with its emphasis on multiple determinants of traits to lay out an elaborate form of somatic classification. His scheme rated physiques along scales that ran from one to seven based of their sphericality, muscularity and linearity, which allowed Sheldon to assign each body a three-digit number. Sheldon maintained that somatotypes did not change over time, even with weight change. He took a similar approach with personality, ranking on the basis of sixty traits that he claimed originated in bodily need and which fell into clusters around relaxation, muscular activity involving action and power, and restraint and inhibition. People with prominent guts (endomorphs) craved relaxation and pampering---both somatic and psychological. Muscle-bound men were driven toward action and power and took little note of others, and so on. Although Sheldon took note of the intensity of traits and even admitted the occasional incompatibility among morphologies and manifest temperaments, physique remained destiny. Not surprisingly, somatotypers were prone to snap judgments. Physical anthropologist Carl Seltzer breezily contended that weak (effeminate by his lights) body types (about 15% of the white, male population) were likely to lack psychic energy, proper motivation, sociability, and appropriate values. Sheldon applauded the 1-7-2 body (which had the highest muscularity and little sphericality or linearity) as the “incarnation of a heroic ideal,” the “masculine ideal of warlike and conquesting people,” the “American eagle of somatotypes.” Committed as he was to an extreme naturalism, Sheldon had animal analogues for most of his somatotypes.[^8]

Sheldon’s overt racism, unfashionable eugenics, and ornery personality initially proved no obstacle to the prominence of his “science.” Sheldon’s theory of a self that derived from the body had large popular and professional followings. Magazines ran such articles as “What Manner of Morph Are You?” and “How Your Shape Shapes Your Life.” Psychologists subjected numerous Ivy League freshmen to nude photographing sessions and psychological probing when arriving on campus. By the mid-1950s, Sheldonism was under critical scrutiny. Detractors charged he mixed causation with correlation, ignored changes in body type, offered “just so” stories as explanations, and had failed to produce convincing results despite years of measuring. His research assistant simply confirmed what critics suspected when she claimed he fudged his classifications so that body and personality type meshed.[^9]

Alfred Kinsey’s approach to the body-self relation has proven more politically and intellectually credible than Sheldon’s. A biologist who claimed to have no vested interest in the outcome, he undertook his famous reports on human sexual behavior as “first of all a report on what people do, which raises no question of what they should do.” Kinsey and his associates obtained data previous investigators had not on such seemingly taboo acts as masturbation, homosexual contact, and non-marital intercourse through innovative interview techniques. The results were surprising to many. Acts thought rare and often morally out of bounds turned out to be fairly common. Taken together, the non-heterosexual, non-marital acts outnumbered marital ones. Given individuals in a variety of different acts, Kinsey classified people not dichotomously but along a spectrum. One was not gay or straight but engaged in primarily one or both acts. Humans regard sexual behavior as “either socially acceptable or unacceptable, heterosexual or homosexual” and do not “want to believe that there are gradations in these matters from one to the other extreme.”[^10] Kinsey’s refusal to apply moral or psychological criteria to his results came through in his insistence that all acts undertaken for sexual release, or “outlet,” were biologically commensurate. In subsequent years, detractors criticized his emphasis on outlet for its assumption of a male norm of sexuality, but the measure also allowed Kinsey to challenge the belief that the vaginal orgasm was the ultimate female sexual experience and to worry that women were not achieving outlet on par with men.

Kinsey’s work struck a chord. Published by a small medical press, the _Reports_ became best-sellers. The male report sold nearly 250,000 copies and the female one eventually surpassed that figure. Americans had become, in the expression of the day, “Kinsey conscious.” Kinsey himself assumed celebrity status, mentioned in Cole Porter’s “Too Darn Hot” from _Kiss Me, Kate_. The reports spurred unprecedented public talk about sex and raised questions about what was normal. Many readers indicated to Kinsey that they sought reassurance by checking his charts and graphs to determine where they fell on his scales. Other readers had more pressing concerns. Haunted by urges and acts often deemed abnormal, many wrote to Kinsey for advice and help. Whether his reassurances soothed their troubles, he forthrightly articulated to those who felt outside the pale that conventional standards were arbitrary, not natural, and need not govern their self-understanding.

Debate over the reports was especially fierce. Lay critics accused Kinsey of encouraging immoral and potentially harmful behavior. Academics concentrated primarily on his methodology and his assumptions. His sample was less diverse than he implied. His American data hardly allowed for generalization to males or females in general. Even as a measure of the United States, the data were limited. As a number of critics noted at the time, his surveys over-represented some groups (whites, middle-class women) and under-represented or excluded others (African Americans were, for reasons Kinsey never made clear, excluded from the volume on female sexual behavior). To survey lower-class men (Kinsey wanted to account for differences in status, income, and age), the report used prisons on the debatable assumption that imprisonment was part of the lower-class cultural norm. Kinsey was also selective in the acts he chose to count, ignoring not just acts that did not lead to orgasm but also group sex, sadism, masochism, and transvestism as too marginal. Nor did he always successfully avoiding equating the average behavior with normal behavior, as he tacitly admitted when he argued that data about a group helps understanding about individuals by showing their relation to the group.[^11]

For many psychiatrists, psychologists and social scientists, however, the problem with the reports was not the revelations about homosexuality or extramarital sexuality but the naturalistic assumptions that concentrated on outlet to the detriment of meaning. For all the information in the reports, they were unlikely to help Americans find themselves, psychiatrists charged, because they have nothing to say about internal states. In ignoring the complexity of consciousness, Kinsey reduced the self to mere biological reflexes and all choice to acting on impulse. By pruning the meaning of a sexual act to release of energy, Kinsey obfuscated the uniqueness of individual sexual lives. His description of sex made no mention of relationships, the institutional context in which sex took place. “Love,” which many critics took to be the culturally sanctioned goal of sex, was absent from the Kinsey investigations. The anthropologist Ashley Montagu complained that Kinsey’s report ignored emotions altogether. The literary critic and advocate of Freud Lionel Trilling argued that Kinsey equated the natural with the good. “Although,” Trilling wrote “the Report directs the harshest language toward the idea of the Normal, saying that it has stood in the way of any true scientific knowledge of sex, it is itself by no means averse to letting the idea of the Natural develop quietly into the idea of the Normal.” That surreptitious assumption, Trilling continued, was why the Kinsey Report “has an extravagant fear of all ideas that do not seem to it to be, as it were, immediately dictated by simple physical fact.”[^12] Margaret Mead charged that the report shared the faults of the culture it purported to measure, an emphasis on size, numbers, money, publicity, and sales.[^13]

Despite their opposition to Kinsey’s naturalism, cultural anthropologists Mead and Montagu both made a more concerted effort in the immediate postwar years to tie selfhood to biological imperative than they had before the war. Their work in the 1940s and 1950s, which circulated widely in such popular venues of _Saturday Review_ and _Redbook_, increasingly emphasized the major role that the kind of body one possessed had in forming one’s identity. One reason that they moved away from their prior cultural relativism in which cultures were judged by their fit and function for a people’s circumstances was their dawning recognition of the inability of the theory to provide a moral bulwark against totalitarianism. Positing a rock-hard biological substratum enabled Montagu, Mead and others to challenge to Soviet claims that they had built the new man by insisting that all was not plastic. Culture now had to work with certain givens. Nowhere was the power of biology to shape identity more apparent than in discussions of its gendering.[^14]

Born Israel Ehrenberg in London in 1905, Montagu had begun his career by challenging the coherence of the concept of race in _Man’s Most Dangerous Myth: The Fallacy of Race_ (1942). Race was not, he argued, rooted in distinctive biological differences since variation within racial groups was as great as among them. Nor did physical markers dictate mental or moral differences. In his draft of the UNESCO statement on race in 1950, Montagu drew on the vitalist biology of the anarchist Petr Kropotkin to insist on a common human nature formed by a biological drive for cooperation. His denial of mental and temperamental differences provoked scholarly criticism for his tendency to overgeneralize from limited evidence. It also led to attacks for alleged Communism, which cost him a position at Rutgers. Carving out a niche for himself as a public expert, he turned his attention to sex differences with _The Natural Superiority of Women_ (1953).

Women, Montagu asserted, were naturally healthier and more intelligent than men, which were qualities that followed from their inclination for cooperation. Most importantly women benefitted psychologically from their physical closeness to children. Montagu’s argument posited an ironclad linkage between biological attributes and social role, which in turn created the valuable components of culture. Montagu envisioned women as the agents of cooperation, altruism and love. “_It is the function of women to teach men how to be human_,” he declared. Women’s biological makeup better suited them for bolstering human relations than for engaging in competitive or solitary pursuits. Given his cooperative ethos, Montagu emphasized female nurturing to give anthropological imprimatur to the gender divisions of American democracy. “It is not for nothing,” he continued in defense of a division of functions, “that the Bolsheviks attempted to abolished the family and masculinize women, while the Nazis made informers of children against their parents, and put the State so much before the family that it became a behemoth that well-nigh destroyed everyone who was victimized by it.”[^15] Montagu saw little variation among cultures; race, class, nation, or region did not alter to any significant extent biological imperative, a reversal of his earlier work. Although sometimes regarded as a precursor of modern feminism because of his praise of female intelligence, creativity and fellow feeling, Montagu was not so much advocating a redistribution of power or role change as securing the foundational qualities of the female self. It was, Eve Merriam wrote, a left-handed compliment from someone whose pre-eminent position enabled such generosity.[^16]

Mead might have made an even sharper biological turn. In 1958, Mead’s interest in biology as a factor in personality development had progressed to the point that she hired Barbara Heath, Sheldon’s former assistant, to do somatotypes in Papua New Guinea. By the early 1960s, she had found some affinity with Konrad Lorenz, the Austrian ethologist whose work on imprinting and on aggression articulated perhaps the most prominent version of biological influence on formation of the self. Her own intervention, _Male and Female_ (1949), contended there was a biological divide between male and female beyond the obvious differences in sexual organs and role in reproduction. She discerned contrasts in energy, attention, perception, and initiative. She also insisted that the female self, whatever else it accomplished, was inextricably engaged with the emotional development of children since its body was the generator of mother love.

That anatomical differences generated different selves represented a change in emphasis from Mead’s earlier work, although one less pronounced than her 1960s critics charged. _Coming of Age in Samoa_ (1928) and _Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies_ (1935) stressed human flexibility and plasticity in sexual orientations, character traits, and role; _Male and Female_ emphasized the universality of division and the limits on plasticity. Mead not only emphasized the split between the sexes in child birth and rearing but further contended that biological differences were at the base of all cultures. All cultures, she insisted, parceled out typical cultural traits along sexual lines. Reluctant to abandon fully her former positions, Mead argued that personality traits did not exclusively line up male or female. Different cultures regarded beauty, intelligence, kindness, or friendliness in different ways. Bravery was not solely a male trait; cooperation did not belong solely to females. If every culture distinguished the female from the male ideal, they did not and could not shape any given individual. Insistence on rigid gender roles was the basis of much “inequality and waste in the world” and blocked full self-development.[^17]

As with her earlier work, _Male and Female_ was both field research report and cultural criticism of the United States. She continued to criticize prudery about somatic functions (including sexual desire) and its inversion, the excessive eroticization of bodies. In both cases, Americans were by her lights culturally limited from productively embracing the physical components of their selves. To these criticisms, Mead added a stinging rebuke of the withdrawal of fathers from parenting responsibilities. Ironically it was American mothers who reminded boys to act like men. Women may bestow validation but typically received little in return. Mead charged that America made women, rather than the relations between men and women, the problem. “As surely as we believe that the present troublesome problems of sex adjustment are due to the position of women alone we commit ourselves to a long series of false moves as we attempt to push women out of the home, into the home, out of the home, adding mounting confusion of the difficulties born of a changing world--climate of opinion, a shifting technology, and an increasing rate and violence of cultural change.”[^18] Such sentiments made her endorsement of the biological imperative of mother love and her insistence on women’s docility and slower-flowering responsiveness different from the widely circulated anti-feminist tract _Modern Woman: The Lost Sex_ (1947) by Ferdinand Lundberg and Marynia Farnham. They blamed American mothers’ abandonment of domestic life for the ills of modern society. Failing to be properly “female,” mothers were the chief instigators of their children’s neurotic personalities.

Mead’s version of the balance between biology and culture was also an intervention in the debates over the work of Sigmund Freud. At issue was the nature of the energy provided by drives or impulses and how modifiable they were by social institutions. Freud’s understanding of the formation of the self had matured over the course of his career, but a fairly constant portion was libido theory. In it, Freud held that _trieb_ (alternatively translated as “drives” or “instinct”) were fundamentally sexual in nature. The energy focuses on different zones at different moments in an individual’s childhood. Should it become fixated on certain parts, psychopathology would arise. Drives are relentless and fundamentally antisocial, leading to efforts to regulate them. This regulation could be conscious (suppression), unconscious (repression through internalization of social prohibitions and norms), or channeled (sublimation). Freud envisioned the individual as continually at odds with him or herself, yet capable of some forms of psychic health by using the energy of the drives for work and love.[^19]

Although revisionists accepted Freud’s notion of a depth psychology in which unconscious motivation--retrievable through dreams, fantasies, and slips--accounted for external behavior, they rejected the libido theory. Such analysts as Erik Erikson, Karen Horney, Harry Stack Sullivan, and Erich Fromm challenged the exclusive concentration on the erotic, Freud’s hydraulic conception of energy that limited the amount available to an individual, and the orthodox assertion of the universality of Oedipal conflict. Revisionists charged that empirical evidence was lacking for all these propositions. Others criticized Freud’s version of female sexuality as incoherent. At bottom, they objected to a view of biological endowment as unalterable and proposed instead a view in which the self under the impress of nature and society was more variable, dynamic, and contingent than orthodox Freudians allowed.[^20]

With its emphasis on social context rather than biologically-based drives, revisionism opened the possibility of connecting psychological development to political change. Most notable in this regard was Erich Fromm, who discerned commonalities between Freud and Marx. “Different as they were, they have in common an uncompromising will to liberate man, an equally uncompromising faith in truth as the instrument of liberation and the belief that the condition for this liberation lies in man's capacity to break the chain of illusion.”[^21] In Fromm’s synthesis, dynamic psychology provided the mechanism by which social existence gave rise to consciousness while historical materialism contributed an etiology to why certain character types predominated at different times in human history. Fromm believed libidinal theory was of limited value in explaining why a particular social class featured a particular character type. It was unlikely, he thought, that every petit bourgeois had anal fixations. If the human instinctual apparatus was not infinitely malleable, it nonetheless changed in response to the historical problems it faced. Fromm’s revisionism was most apparent in his view of the family as the conduit of historical context through the particular bodily and psychic gratification structure. As long as it bestowed the proper rewards, the family would give rise to the typical character type. Should families cease to deliver rewards, the stage was set for new character types and social change.[^22]

If Fromm jettisoned orthodoxy for radical ends, others hewed to it for similar reasons. Although the analytic establishment used Freud to secure patient adjustment to normal social life, thinkers diverse as Herbert Marcuse, Lionel Trilling, and the sociologist Dennis Wrong glimpsed in Freudian libido theory the possibility of true opposition to the political and social status quo. They held that the drives did _not_ set the self forever but opened possibilities for overturning social convention. Revisionists had treated nature as a form of determinism, but their work relied on what Wrong termed the oversocialized conception of man (sic). By positing social and cultural causation activated by an ingrained need for approval, revisionism turned out at bottom to be a theory of conformity in which rebels were incompletely socialized. Freud himself was dismissive of social revolution, but his conception of the self caught between drive and internalized social restriction was a portrait of a person in struggle. Aware that the manifestation of instincts was not fixed, defenders of the libido theory envisioned ways that redirected instincts could aid nonconformist ends. For the literary critic Trilling, the biological substratum remained beyond conformity to culture. For the philosopher Marcuse, the unleashing of eros was an attack on capitalist society’s conversion of sex energy into alienated labor. “The irreconcilable conflict is not between work (reality principle) and Eros (pleasure principle), but between alienated labour (performance principle) and Eros,” Marcuse proclaimed.[^23] In their desire to separate themselves from what they regarded as the conformist tendencies of neo-Freudianism, both Marcuse and Trilling flirted with positions that made bodily pleasure the sole measure of meaningful selfhood, underplaying the contributions of Enlightenment reason. A fear that American culture might co-opt the supposedly liberated aspects of instinctual life later led Marcuse to advance the idea of repressive desublimation in _One-Dimensional Man_ (1964).[^24]

Although most debate revolved around how the body determined identity, there were instances where self and body became unconnected and revealed how plastic gender behavior could be. Some were played for fun, as in Billy Wilder’s film _Some Like It Hot_ (1959), in which Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis dress and live as women to escape gangsters. Others, such as the case of Christine Jorgensen went to the heart of body and identity. Although born with a penis, George William Jorgensen felt early on as a child that she was a woman trapped in a man’s body. Although psychoanalysts regarded such a condition as a mental illness, the result of improper identification with the properly sexed parent during early childhood, medical doctors regarded the condition as inadequate physical development of the proper sexual characteristics. Beginning hormone therapy with the husband of a classmate, Jorgensen traveled to Europe to have sex reassignment surgery which she completed in Denmark in 1951 and 1952. Jorgensen became an instant celebrity upon her return to the United States. Often an object of derisive humor, Jorgensen responded by adopting a glamorous and outgoing persona, quite different from her diffidence as a boy. Forbidden from marrying (her birth certificate indicated she was male), she nonetheless by her very existence demonstrated that gender was not a binary, incommensurate condition and that genitalia and chromosomes alone did not provide a completely solid foundation for identity.[^25]



**The Crowd and the Lonely**



For a people who proclaimed their devotion to individualism, midcentury Americans were inveterate joiners. Such organizations as the Boy Scouts, Parent-Teachers Association and the League of Women Voters experienced tremendous growth from 1950 to 1960, virtually doubling during the period. Socializing was central to commercial ventures as well. The much-derided Tupperware---plastic covered dishes intended to store leftovers ---was founded in 1948 and rose to cultural prominence and lucrative returns on the strength of its marketing through “Tupperware parties” of friends and neighbors. As commentators puzzled out the meaning of American joining, they ultimately confronted the question of whether society was too much or too little present in the formation of the integrated self. On the one hand, social critics created a cottage industry in the criticism of American conformity, singling out suburbia and corporate bureaucracies as the prime offenders. Such social pressure, they maintained, interfered with the development of a true self and left the individual at the mercy of others. Others worried that social bonds were too thin and too superficial to support the needs of human development. Cut adrift, dependent on their own meager resources, and bereft of meaningful interaction, Americans were bound to be stunted, myopic and narcissistic.[^26]

Although there is very little discussion of loneliness as the term is usually understood, David Riesman’s _Lonely Crowd_ (1950) takes as its central problem the changing relationship of the self and others. Riesman developed an interest in sociology during his analysis with Erich Fromm. Originally, he and his associates Reuel Denney and Nathan Glazer set out to study apathy during the 1948 presidential election; the project morphed into a study of which abstract character type predominated at a given stage of the past. Where once the prevailing personality type was inner-directed, transformation in social organization --- particularly the rise of bureaucracy and mass communications --- gave rise to the other-directed type. Inner-directeds, as the name suggests, subscribed to values and followed a code of behavior she or he has internalized. In contrast, other-directed people took their cues from social expectations and the reactions of their fellows. Inner-directed folks gained identity primarily from work; outer-directeds organized their self-conception around leisure and consumption. The other directed was a life filled with anxiety, as opposed to the inner-directed’s guilt.

Many readers interpreted Riesman’s book as deploring the rise of the other-directed personality, which they saw as conformist, insecure, and dependent. Riesman rightly denied he was simply lamenting the decline of nineteenth-century individualism or criticizing conformity as such. Riesman was clear that the issue was _how_, not whether, a society induces conformity. Nineteenth-century America did so through a similar internal code that resulted in envy and emulation among inner-directed strivers. The other-directed, he noted, conformed from an “greater resonance with others, a heightened self-consciousness about relations to people, and a widening of the circle with whom one wants to feel in touch.” Nor did he think the inner-directed personality was particularly admirable, pointing to its crabbed, constricted and parochial nature. The inner-directed man may have had his internal code, but the circle of others who were acceptable was quite small and his inner censor could be unproductively unforgiving. Inner direction may have suited the class-conflict ridden stage of capitalism but was hardly the model for personal freedom in the modern age.[^27]

Riesman hardly depicted the other-directed as models of meaningful and self-aware selfhood. Other-direction enabled insincere glad-handing and mood engineering designed to influence vaguely discomforted individuals uncertain about whether or not they fit in. As a type, the other-directed personality resembled Fromm’s marketing personality, who treated his self as if it were a commodity. Drawing identity from consumption rather than work, other-directeds were especially vulnerable to swings in fashion. Like Arthur Miller’s Willie Loman in _Death of a Salesman _(1949), other-directeds were often convinced they had “sterling traits of character” and “a pleasing personality” and often found it difficult to face reality. Yet Riesman envisioned positive aspects to other-direction as well. Aware of others, the other-directed self was more empathetic, sensitive, tolerant, and flexible. Riesman contended that the other-directed was more prone to examining inner life and better suited to a world in which work had been so degraded that it could no longer contribute to a worthwhile identity. An emerging orientation, the other-directed heralded either a new openness or a therapeutic world view in which attention to one’s feelings trumped all other considerations.

The most tantalizing but least realized portion of the book was Riesman’s discussion of autonomy. Now that the problem of production had been virtually solved, Riesman argued, freedom was a psychosocial problem rather than a material one. Although Riesman had noted in a letter to Denney the possibility that in some circumstances alienation could be a legitimate response to a society that bore down too heavily on individuals, he ultimately tended to regard the condition as anomie, the breakdown of social connection and norms. More preferable was autonomy, which he conceded was relatively rare, especially in a regime of outer-direction. He envisioned autonomy achieved through membership in multiple communities, creative consumption by which he meant knowledgeable use of an item, and the ability to know and master one’s own desires. The details remained relatively sketchy in Riesman’s account but his remained an effort to discover a creativity amidst what he conceded was general joylessness. That led Daniel Bell to label him a prophet of play who overemphasized the degree to which consumption yielded the kind of freedom that Riesman wanted. Indeed, by the late 1960s, Riesman worried that efforts to go one’s own way had become willful efforts to depart from norms for their own sake, as if eccentricity proved one was not other-directed.

Others were less subtle than Riesman. The cover for _Time Magazine_’s 1954 story on Riesman featured a man in a business suit with a radar transmitter on his back looking to the future and the Victorian figure with a compass moving back into the mists of the past while the masses behind the bespectacled Riesman remain faceless. Riesman’s work sparked related popular ventures, particularly the social criticism of Vance Packard and William H. Whyte. Both were deeply critical of institutional exploitation of fears of being different, a tendency they saw as a defining feature of modern bureaucratic life. Whyte and Packard regarded the corporation as the nerve-center of a collectivist culture that evoked insecurities, nudging America toward Tocqueville-like state of conformity in which ostensibly free individuals feared any difference with their fellows. Keeping up with the Joneses was not simply a striving to be included or to improve one’s material well being, but a central component of the American good life. Whyte contended that it came with a new consciousness for the modern age, “groupthink,” the conscious justification for conformity on the grounds that group wisdom was superior to that of individuals. With “groupthink” came personality transformation. Americans had become so afraid of the rejection occasioned by being different that conformity took hold beyond the office to the homes of corporate drones in the suburbs. It was a view echoed in Malvina Reynolds’s song about “Little Boxes” made of “ticky-tacky” and Betty Friedan’s portrait of the suburban housewife as living in a comfortable concentration camp and deeply unfulfilled. Packard’s criticism was directed at institutions of manipulation and standardization, such as advertising, product design, and public relations. Although resonating throughout the culture, Packard and Whyte’s broadsides proved overstated --- the suburbs, including the supposed epitome of conformity, Levittown, were much less conformist than they claimed. Nor could they offer any meaningful way to oppose conformity. The best alternative that Whyte could offer was an appendix on cheating on personality tests.[^28]

Whyte and Packard’s lament for the autonomous self who resisted social pressure was echoed in the popular film genre that enjoyed something of a heyday in midcentury, the Western. The typical 1950s Western probed the social and cultural conflict that arose when rugged individualism lost its social utility. At odds with the direction of history, Western heroes constantly drift or die. Despite their ostensible celebration of their protagonist’s resistance to social demands, midcentury Westerns have an elegiac feel. Heroic bold action ends with complete alienation from the community. John Wayne’s Tom in Howard Hawks’s _Red River_ (1948) is a rugged individualist par excellence who demands others bend to his will. He regards others’ needs as a personal attack and treats compromise as weakness. During a crucial cattle drive, his violent and inhumane behavior boils over in a mutiny led by his adopted son, Montgomery Clift’s Matt, whom in a reversal of the Oedipal drama Tom vows to kill. In the case of _Shane_ (1953), the titular character is caught between his gunslinging nature and his desire to put his past away. When a cattle baron and his henchmen attempt to engross the fertile land of the valley, threatening the farm family where Shane works and boards, he abandons his pledge, killing the treacherous baron and his hired guns in a showdown. Though the young boy who idolizes him wants Shane to “come back,” Shane intuitively understands the impossibility of a self like his living peaceably with others, even as his skills constitute a precondition for society. In _High Noon_ (1952) the incompatibility lies in the unprincipled conformity of those who compose respectful society. Hearing that a criminal, whom he had put away in jail was returning to exact his revenge, sheriff Will Kane (Gary Cooper) feels it incumbent to stand his ground, even though he was about to leave for the East with his new bride. Efforts to recruit help are unavailing and Kane faces the onslaught alone (with the help of his Quaker wife). Often taken as an allegory for Hollywood cravenness in the face of HUAC threats, the film earned praise for Kane’s doing what was right when others would not. Interestingly, Hawks and Wayne could not abide the film on grounds that the townsfolk were cowards and Kane was weak for asking for help and for ultimately being saved by his wife. Ronald Reagan, on the other hand, loved the film.[^29]

Placing the western in the present day only exacerbated the incongruity of the autonomous hero. In _Lonely Are the Brave_ (1962), written by the once-blacklisted Dalton Trumbo from eco-anarchist Edward Abbey’s novel _The Brave Cowboy_, loner Jack Burns (Kirk Douglas) proves unable to function in modernity. The film drives the point home from the beginning where Burns at home on the range is discombobulated by screaming jets, gear-shifting trucks that make highway crossings on a horse nearly impossible, and barbed-wire fences that block free passage. Burns makes to trek from the New Mexico mountains to free his friend Paul, who has been jailed for smuggling Mexican refugees into the country. Once in town, Burns sets out to get arrested so he can break Paul out of jail with hacksaw blades he has smuggled into the prison. When family man Paul decides the costs of jail break are greater than doing the time, Burns escapes by himself. Chased by the forces of law and order with its radios and helicopters up the Sandia Mountains, Burns temporarily manages to evade capture, even shooting down a copter. Yet in the midst of trying to cross a highway, his horse once again spooks and Burns is hit by a truck carrying, in an excess of symbolism, a load of toilets.

Douglas secured the rights and hired Trumbo to tell a story about the near impossibility of maintaining authentic individuality in a mass society bent on classifying and regulating its citizens. Burns has no ID cards because he knows who he is. He rejects fences and no trespassing signs because they represent society’s encroachment on his freedom. Director David Miller reinforced the point visually by showing the mountains and deserts of New Mexico in panoramic shots that emphasized the openness and freedom of nature and shooting the machinery and enclosed rooms of civilized society in claustrophobic closeups. In the end, of course, modern civilization would prove triumphant and doom folks like Burns. Yet Trumbo punctuated the requiem for the independent self with a caveat. Burns tells Jerry, Paul’s wife, with whom he was once in love that he was unfit for marriage, “Know what a loner is? He's a born cripple. He's a cripple because the only person he can live with is himself. It's his life, the way he wants to live. It's all for him. A guy like that, he'd kill a woman like you. Because he couldn't love you, not the way you are loved.” Such a scene can be read as an equation of solitude with selfishness. It might also be understood as a reaffirmation of gender differences: only men have the wherewithal to live as they want to live.

Another, less conventional, version of authentic individuality arrived via the Beats, the best-known midcentury bohemians. Convinced that conventional American life demanded sterile routines that denied individuals genuine freedom, the motley collection of writers, poets, and artists stridently asserted their rejection of social norms that repressed impulses, outlawed meaningful experience, and demanded standardization of thought, feeling, and action. In reaction to a society that was overly sentimental and inauthentic, Beats adopted an attitude of cool, a reserved distance from convention. In contrast to middle-class norms of restraint and caution, Beats favored spontaneity. In protest of the mainstream insistence on propriety, Beats embraced the margins of society, seeking out the company of criminals, drugs addicts, deviants, and denigrated minorities. It was this spirt that Jack Kerouac expressed when the narrator of his 1957 novel, _On the Road_, Sal Paradise, declared “the only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones that never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn” and celebrated the black community of Denver because “the best the white world had offered was not enough ecstasy for me, not enough life, joy, kicks, darkness, music, not enough night.”[^30]

Most unsympathetic commentators regarded Beats as conformist in their nonconformity and engaged in a juvenile reaction against adulthood. Writing in the _Partisan Review_, Norman Podhoretz lambasted their worship of primitive energy: “The plain truth is that the primitivism of the Beat Generation serves first of all as a cover for an anti-intellectualism so bitter that it makes the ordinary American’s hatred of eggheads seem positively benign.”[^31] Others saw racial stereotyping in the guise of admiration and a disregard for women’s contributions. Yet Beats were more than nay-saying hedonists. They overestimated the freedom they had achieved, but their quest to embrace experiences mainstream American frowned upon entailed a project of constructing a self unfettered by social boundaries whatsoever. As their embrace of madness indicates, the Beats regarded sanity as encasing and restricting the self. Drawing an eclectic mix of philosophical elements ranging from Eastern religion to the mysticism of William Blake, the Beats were even ready to jettison the self altogether as an illusion. The Beat self, William Burroughs observed needed to learn “to exist with no religion, no country, no allies” and “to live alone in silence.” Coming from a left-wing Jewish family, Allen Ginsberg could condemn in “America” (1956), a United States that committed crimes against Tom Mooney, Spanish Loyalists, and Scottsboro Boys and that sported such cultural monstrosities as television, _Time_ magazine, and Henry Ford. Yet his resistance to the prison of centered selfhood enabled him to make common cause with the libertarian Burroughs and the Catholic anti-Communist Kerouac.[^32]

Beat spontaneity did not result in a consistent philosophy. More philosophically sophisticated in its consideration of the meaning and dilemmas of identity was existentialism. Although as historian George Cotkin has argued several strains of American thought had existential themes, the philosophy did not take hold until European versions arrived in mid-twentieth century. The thought of Soren Kierkegaard, introduced through the efforts of neo-Orthodox Episcopal minister, Walter Lowrie, led figures as diverse as Reinhold Niebuhr, Will Herberg, Whitaker Chambers, and Arthur Schlesinger, Junior to temper or reject their one-time expansive hopes for social transformation. Existentialism gathered steam with the New York intellectuals’ discovery and promotion of the French writers, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and Albert Camus in the mid-1940s, but all three had unsatisfactory visits to United States. Their hosts criticized the existentialists for their flirtation with Marxism (Camus being an exception), shallow knowledge of Freud, and mass-media posturing. Nonetheless existentialism remained attractive as a philosophy of authenticity that enjoined individuals not to accept fate but instead create their identities as singular, unique beings. More than the pose of Greenwich Village coffeehouse habitués, existentialism proved a bracing challenge and support for those searching for an understanding of where they stood in the world. One sign of its success was the appearance of such academic efforts to provide meaningful genealogies and commentary as Hazel Barnes’s _The Literature of Possibility_ (1957) and Walter Kaufmann’s _Existentialism From Dostoevsky to Sartre_ (1956). By the mid-1960s, existentialism had profoundly affected the novelists Anne Rice and Marge Piercy, the feminist Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, and radicals Tom Hayden and Robert Moses, and, ironically, given their opposing sexual politics, Betty Friedan and Norman Mailer.[^33]

Existentialism defined the human condition as strikingly individual. Though humans live in groups, our consciousness and our death were ours alone. Where determinisms wrongly subsumed particulars under abstract and ultimately meaningless concepts, existentialism was concerned with recognizing contingencies and making rather than discovering truth. At the core of things was the necessity of human choice. It was the inescapability of making choices and creating an identity that gave meaning to the famous Sartrean aphorism that existence precedes essence. Many of those choices were crucial ones that could not be fudged and committed one to a particular course, “either/or” in the parlance rather than “both/and.” Even though the world was absurd in the sense that meaning was not given, having to make a choice conferred a seriousness to life and required individuals to assume responsibility for whom one was and whom one became. One could not evade the responsibility of choice even if one occupied a lowly social position or suffered through oppressive conditions, a point Camus advanced in his “Myth of Sisyphus.” Condemned to the absurdity of forever pushing a boulder up a mountain, Sisyphus nonetheless differed from the inhuman boulder because he retained the ability to deny fate and make deliberate choices about what he would do. Sartre labeled bad faith any denial of responsibility for one’s situation. It was inauthentic to simply shrug one’s shoulders and assert this is just the way I am. Borrowing from phenomenological discussion of consciousness, Sartre asserted resignation denied our awareness, however dim and distant, that we are always more than ourselves. Existentialists insisted there was no greater inauthenticity than accepting without passionate engagement and choice social conventions.

Although Sartre once wrote “hell is other people,” existentialists were wary of blithe libertarianism and the egoism of exclusive self regard. Having condemned the bad faith of acquiescing in a socially-imposed identity, existentialists also challenged the bad faith of pretending antecedent conditions had no effect whatsoever, as if all things were possible. One of those antecedent conditions that the French recognized was society itself. That recognition gave the politics of the existentialists social concerns. For de Beauvoir, authenticity required an open future which extends itself by opening the freedom of others. It also presented Sartre and de Beauvoir with the task of squaring the individual freedom of existentialism expounded in “Existentialism is Humanism” with the social causation of Marxism. Sartre’s effort to weave together collective and individual action in _The Critique of Dialectical Reason_ was at best only partially successful. The liberal Camus regarded the project as utopian politics because it treated class as an abstraction and justified positions on the grounds of historical necessity. Doing so necessarily drained values from political action and substituted revolutionary fervor for regard for others. Concerned to keep means and ends in balance, Camus opted for a reformist politics that accepted in some fashion the positions of others. That stance could founder on the search for an unachievable middle position, as in his untenable hope that the Algerian crisis could be resolved in a compromise that left French nationals in their unique place in the colony while honoring the desire of indigenous Algerians for independence. Camus nonetheless proved tremendously inspiring for Americans eager for a new politics that combined the individual authenticity of social opposition with an acceptance of legitimate social bonds. His influence could be found in such documents of the New Left as _The Port Huron Statement_ and _Liberation_ magazine.

Worry over the legitimacy of social bonds accounted for the constant talk about alienation and the near ubiquity of the phrase “failure to communicate.” It surfaced as well in the widespread prominence of the theme of loneliness in postwar discourse. Artwork as diverse as Nicholas Ray’s _In a Lonely Place_ (1950), Hank Williams’s “I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry” (1949), H. J. J. Straelen’s introduction to existentialism, _Man, the Lonely_ (1952), Dorothy Day's autobiography, _The Long Loneliness_ (1952), Chester Himes’s _Lonely Crusade_ (1947), Margaret Wood’s social psychological exploration, _Paths to Loneliness_ (1953), and Clark Moustakas’s psychological cum philosophical investigation of _Loneliness_ (1961) raised the question of how to make meaningful connections in an age of impersonality. Such concerns testified to a new meaning for the word “lonely.” Previous generations had understood the term to mean feelings arising from being physically alone, the consequence of being friendless or losing a loved one. They regarded the condition as an inescapable part of life. After the war, the term also came to signify feelings of insufficient or unrewarding social connections, feelings that were liable to arise at any moment or with any interaction. Modern loneliness implied something askew in social relations or something lacking in the kinds of people produced by such relations. “Only connect,” E. M. Forester wrote in _Howard’s End_ but many worried that connection was simply not possible in American life as currently constituted.

No one at midcentury did a more thorough job of showing the contrast between ideals of togetherness and the less palatable truths of American life than photographer Robert Frank. His _Americans_ (1958), criticized at the time for being politically unacceptable and aesthetically bankrupt, has taken on iconic status since. Born to a Swiss Jewish family, Frank came to United States in 1947, working first as a fashion photographer. With the help of famed photographer Walker Evans, Frank won a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1955 to photograph wide swathes of American life. Traveling from coast to coast over the course of two years, Frank took some 28,000 shots of which eighty-three were eventually published in the book. Initially unable to find an American publisher primarily because of his departure from prevailing norms in focus and lighting, Frank succeeded with the French publisher Robert Delpire in 1958 before landing with Grove Press in the United States the following year. Aiding Grove Press’s decision was the introduction provided by Jack Kerouac, who praised for Frank for having “sucked a sad poem right out of America onto film, taking rank among the tragic poets of the world.”[^34] Within the next three years, he had major shows at the Chicago Art Institute and the Museum of Modern Art.

Frank’s aesthetic choices underwrote his thematic ones. His sense that the United States was a lonely, often bleak place stemmed not simply from his experiences but his long-standing opposition to sentimentality and beauty in art as false. He fretted that beauty obscured broader social implications, holding that perfect composition would make it less likely that the viewer would move beyond the frame. In contrast to professional photographers, Frank preferred blurred, grainy, and muddy exposures that he believed opened access to the underlying forces and truth of a situation. Frank rejected lighting that directed viewers to the expressive features of common humanity, opting instead to capture Americans with blank or tormented looks. In his pictures of sparsely populated bars, marching bands in which instruments obscure musicians’ faces, and automobile drivers and passengers unusually cropped to give the impression of unknown destinations and separation from the environments, Frank put a punctuation point on his sense of the desolation of American life.[^35]

Americans’ inability to connect with one another was especially clear in two of his downtown New Orleans photographs. The first captures pedestrians trying to make their way, only to find themselves impeded by a stream heading the other way. Like particles in Brownian motion, they collide, streaming this way and that. All in caught in grim and unsmiling profile. No one is looking at anyone else (one person is taking a wary glance at us, the audience). Some are looking down. Together they create a mass that extends the entire width of the frame. Determined to move onward, they appear to have neither connection with anyone else despite the claustrophobic quality of the image nor apparent destination—a graphic representation of a lonely crowd. The second, more iconic image captures the agonies of urban segregation. The photo, which graced the original cover, was entitled “Trolley New Orleans.” In typical Southern fashion, whites sit in the front and blacks in the rear. All passengers are looking out at us with varying emotions, ranging from contempt or dismissal from the white woman in the second row to anguish on the face of the black man two rows behind her. It is clearly a warm day since the windows are opened. The raised windows distort the reflection from the street and we can make out what might be apartment buildings, bridges, or pedestrians. Whatever they are, they shimmer like mirages. The open windows create an impression of cells in which each of the passengers is sealed off from his or her fellows, an effect driven home by the longing in their looks and the glistening jambs.

Frank did not arrange his photos in chronological order. Nor did he set out to tell a particular story. He did, however, have themes to which he returned --- automobiles, bars, race, and, perhaps most poignant of all, flags. Frank deployed flags not as a symbol of unity but as an unfamiliar and divisive object. In “Parade - Hoboken, New Jersey,” the flag itself serves decapitate. Rather than depicting a parade, the picture shows two apartment dwellers looking out at a parade, or so we assume. The woman in the left window is not fully visible. A white shade is partially drawn, creating a deep shadow. We are only able to make out her chin and mouth. Between the windows is an unfurled flag, blowing in the breeze. Fairly taut, it blows in such a way to make the face of the second woman invisible to us. The flag dominates the composition but it ensures Americans remain unknown to each other. The reality of division stands against the ideal of unity.

The counterpart of Frank in painting was George Tooker. Born in Brooklyn, trained by the famed Depression-era illustrator and chronicler of New York life, Reginald Marsh, Tooker adopted a style of figurative representation, unusual juxtapositions, bleak lighting, and ambiguous or complex perspectives, a style that he called “reality impressed on the mind so hard that it returns as a dream.” His paintings were fantasies or reveries, he insisted, but of a world drained of human interaction, deep emotion and individual initiative. His figures shuffle rather than walk, and often seem isolated, imprisoned, or estranged. Typically an oppressive architecture overwhelms them, as the anonymity and standardization of modern life defines their environment. This approach dominates such works of midcentury as _The Subway_ (1950), _Government Bureau_ (1955-1956), and _Waiting Room_ (1959). In the first, the effects of mass society in all its horror impresses itself on the viewer almost immediately. The multiple vanishing points, the confining cubicles in which numerous people wait or hide, the depressed sorrowful or blank expressions on the riders’ faces, the metal grating, all contribute to the tenor of solitary nature of alienation. Tooker claimed the subway was the epitome of “a denial of the senses and a negation of life itself.”[^36]

Popular song has long trafficked in loneliness, plying the distance between the ideal of love and the reality of abandonment. Midcentury saw more than its share of mawkish tropes. Songs aimed at teenagers, whose inexperience leads them to imagine their condition will last forever, often delighted in the pain as a sign of sensitivity. Occasionally, however, pop songs gave the loneliness a new twist. Although Ricky Nelson cared less for pop ballads than the rockabilly of Sun Records, his father-manager, Ozzie, believed his vocal abilities were more suited for the former, and had him sing on the family’s franchise, the television show _Ozzie and Harriet_. Ricky play himself on the show, which took a fateful turn after Rickey recorded a version of Fats Domino’s “I’m Walkin’” in 1957 to impress his date. After that he performed regularly, boosting the ratings and easing the acceptance of rock ’n’ roll in many American households. “Poor Little Fool,” (1958), “A Teenager’s Romance,” (1957), and “Lonesome Town” (1958) all charted and made Nelson a heart throb. It was that experience that gave credibility to his last great success of his early career, “Teenage Idol” (1962). Much of “Idol” is a standard-issue complaint about the lack of emotional fulfillment in stardom. Those who envy the singer have no way of knowing how lonesome he can be since he’s always passing through, with no time to find someone with whom he can truly talk. In accord with the genre, Nelson maintains fame and fortune won’t mean a thing if he’s all alone. What is noteworthy is the linkage between traveling, stardom and loneliness in a song designed for teenage girls --- something rarely done in midcentury. On the one hand, the troubles of the rich and famous hardly evoke empathy. The obvious retort to the throwaway line about the worthlessness of fame and fortune is to advise the singer to stay home. On the other, the ubiquity of lonesomeness makes the celebrity jes’ folks. The idol is no more suited to escape the nexus of loneliness than any other American, except most other Americans can't sing a song that evoked the desire to relieve Nelson of his loneliness.

It was the contribution of Frank Sinatra to create a body of work that moved beyond predictable laments and conveyed how loneliness dissolved facades and personas, revealing an essential vulnerability. Born in 1915, Sinatra had achieved 1940s success singing for a number of large bands, including Tommy Dorsey and Harry James. A teen idol in the mid-1940s, he hit a rough patch thereafter in which he was reduced to doing novelty songs. Released from his Columbia contract, he staged a comeback in the 1950s with an Oscar for his role in _From Here to Eternity_ (1953) and sixteen albums for Capitol in which he reinvented himself as a mature, complex singer. The Capitol albums were not so much random collections of songs than ones organized around a theme or concept. Some featured the hip Sinatra, a jaunty and charming rogue with a jazz sensibility. Contrasting with the swinging Sinatra was the lonely one, who could not transcend the damages of his failed love life and went through his daily life unconnected to and unaware of others. In albums _In the Wee Small Hours_ (1955), _Where are You?_ (1957), _Only the Lonely_ (1958)--which Sinatra called his favorite--and _No One Cares_ (1959), Sinatra revealed a self crumbling under the pressure of isolation. Bolstering the effect was the album art, which portrayed a devastated Sinatra in ways few stars of his magnitude would have allowed. _Only the Lonely_ featured Sinatra as a clown obscured by a black background so that only half his face is discernible and the visible part touched with red highlights on lips, nose and eyes to give the impression of a crying clown. _No One Cares_ has him sitting alone and forlorn bathed in light while all around him couples socialize.[^37]

Sinatra’s 1950s work subtly explored the varieties of loneliness, revealing a self insecure even when appearing confident to others. With the help of arrangers Nelson Riddle and Gordon Jenkins, Sinatra summoned a complex psychological landscape full of precariousness and disquiet. These effects owed much to Sinatra’s talents and musical intelligence. His celebrated breath control enabled him to emulate both the operatic bel canto style, which varied legato and staccato passages while frequently altering tempo, and Dorsey’s trombone virtuosity. With his flexible phrasing and accenting, Sinatra mastered a conversational style of singing that enabled him to project a variety of vulnerabilities, in contrast to the strident, even parodic, masculinity of his “swinging” albums. In fraying his voice or shifting between major and minor keys without musical resolution, Sinatra constructed a singing self that lacked poise and closure. In those cases, where the song, like an operatic recitative, lacked a real tune, Sinatra captured the midcentury despair at the inability of the self to find its center in social life.

Sinatra skillfully moved in his so-called “down” albums between gloom, resignation and disorientation. The immediate causes were failed love affairs or the inability to shake a depressed state that itself intensifies the blows that others delivered. At times reflective, at others accepting, and still others defeated, Sinatra’s songs of loneliness were a marked contrast to the bromides of national happiness and formulaic popular songs like Nelson’s that mention, not inhabit, loneliness. In “Stormy Weather” on _No One Cares_, Sinatra’s voice begins full in a lower register but as he realizes that he just can’t get his “poor self together,” his accents begin to fall irregularly. In his rendition of Rodgers’s and Hart’s “Spring is Here” on _Only the Lonely_, Sinatra achieves great effect in singing in minor key on the wrong accent when singing about moments that are normally would make one merry. One would expect that the rebirth that comes with a new season should produce a dancing heart. His confession that loneliness puts an end to ambition and desire stand is dragged out and slurred. Alienation from others is especially clear in a song that would appear at his concert well into the 1980s, “Angel Eyes.” The contrast between the happy drinking people and the singer is palpable, made all the more poignant by the change in tempo and the modulation of volume. In the beginning of the song, Sinatra is fighting against the music: it is light, he is dark. His mood prevails, however, and the celebratory tone of the music disappears. By the end, the protective coverings are stripped away and so too is the singer. As he sings, “excuse me, while I disappear.”

The problem of loneliness generated calls for adopting of cheery attitude, joining groups, and, should those fail to alleviate feelings, therapy. The tendency to treat the somber feelings that accompany being alone as a problem led a few writers to assert that not all states of aloneness were detrimental to a meaningful sense of self. Clark Moustakas maintained that reflexive flight from solitude was an effort to avoid inner life and ran the risk of self-alienation and feelings of inferiority. Those “not open enough, flexible enough, expansive enough to attach” themselves “to new personas and find value in new experiences” were frightened to face loneliness. Confronting the sense of absence provoked an “intense and timeless awareness of the Self which allows for new sensitivities and awareness, and which results in bringing a person deeply in touch with his own existence and in touch with others in a fundamental sense.”[^38] Moustakas concentrated on particularly vivid or life-changing experiences such as the sudden and severe illness of children, war injuries, the dread evoked by mountain climbing or exploring the unknown, political trials and tribulations (he mentions both Alger Hiss and Whitaker Chambers) but insisted that courting loneliness will help with quotidian living. The Catholic convert and social activist Dorothy Day experienced the new self that emerged from loneliness as rebirth in religious terms. Solitude enabled her to become aware of the full extent of her sinfulness and realize that true selfhood existed in a religious community involved in the life of others.[^39] Day’s loneliness and Moustakas’ loneliness were not, it should be said, the usual experience of the time.


**The Young and the Restless**


Few discussions of the Fifties fail to mention the species known as the American teenager, identifiable by its common experience of high school and its own particular culture and behavioral repertoire. As Joseph Kett has demonstrated, before the twentieth century Americans were unaccustomed to thinking of the teen years as a distinct period devoted to experimentation and preparation for adulthood, or to assume that puberty was accompanied by emotional turbulence. The first full articulation of youth as a transitional state suspended between childhood and adulthood was the psychologist G. Stanley Hall’s _Adolescence_ (1904). Hall saw the condition as one of storm and stress, marked by conflict with parents, mood swings and risky behavior. “Youth,” he wrote, “awakes to a new world and understands neither it nor himself.” Hall’s concept was the province of experts until midcentury when the term “teenager” came into general use. It arose primarily to demarcate a group that had enough disposable income to constitute a market segment that marketeers could exploit. With its general use, the concept signified social insecurities and career uncertainties in addition to Hall’s storm and stress. American adolescents were a distinctive breed. According to a famous post-Sputnik _Life_ magazine story, they were the reverse of their Soviet counterparts. Where soviet teenagers were dedicated to their studies and committed to the success of their nation, Americans obsessed over dating, sports, and possession of the latest consumer goods. There were clearly racial and class components to this characterization of teenagers as concerned with fun, fun, fun to the exclusion of all else. The growing visibility of black and Latino and working-class teenagers spurred panic about juvenile delinquency and fears about unformed white youth imitating those examples.[^40]

Adult puzzlement about teenagers stimulated numerous reports from the field in order to understand the condition. As is often the case for voyages to unknown lands, the accounts were diametrically opposed to one another. The classic conception of the teenage state was psychoanalyst Erik Erikson’s _Childhood and Society_ (1951). Best known for its psychological elaboration of the concept of identity, the book melded the biological and social struggles on the road to adulthood in a way that drew upon Erikson’s training and inclinations. Born in 1902 in Frankfort, uncertain who was his father (which, biographers have speculated, accounts for his interest in identity), he migrated in 1927 to Vienna to teach at a school designed for children whose parents were in treatment with Anna Freud. At her urging, he enrolled at the Vienna Psychoanalytic Institute, where he received his diploma in 1933. Harassed by the Nazis, he and his wife Joan set sail for the United States that same year. Using his contacts in the culture and personality school of anthropologists--- Edward Sapir, Margaret Mead, Alfred Kroeber, and Ruth Benedict ---Erikson spent time observing the Sioux and the Yoruk before taking a position at the University of California. Those observations bore fruit in _Childhood and Society_’s emphasis on the culture-bound nature of personality development. Critical of efforts to enforce conformity by edict, he left the Berkeley campus in the early 1950s in protest of the requirement that faculty sign loyalty oaths.

_Childhood and Society_ laid out eight stages of life, each of which linked biological development to what Erikson termed a psychosocial crisis. As individuals attempt to master the bodily functions and the corresponding life task, they encounter a set of conflicts that raise existential questions. So the initial stage of life in which the infant struggles with oral mastery and negotiates between inside and outside is rooted in the relationship with the mother and raises the question of trust. Subsequent stages involve bowel control, which opens up the psychosocial crisis of negotiating autonomy versus shame and doubt and raises the existential question of whether it is okay to be oneself, and motor control, which inaugurates the psychosocial crisis of initiative versus guilt, which leads to the existential question of whether it is permissible to move and act. Erikson’s sequence is cumulative: successful negotiation of the crisis of each stage yields rewards or “virtues.” A child who negotiates the trust - mistrust psychosocial challenge will emerge with hope. Passing through the second stage with a sense of autonomy rather than shame or doubt, for instance, bestows the virtue of will. Although Erikson posed one pole of the challenge as the optimal or desirable force, he was well aware that both were needed for healthy living. Some mistrust of others is surely warranted, as is retaining some reserves of shame and doubt. Those who could not balance psychosocial forces or interact with the outside in productive ways could, Erikson maintained, pass on to the next stage, but the residue of the unsuccessful challenge would reassert itself in problems in later life.[^41]
The contrast with Freudian orthodoxy was marked. Rather than emphasize the conflicts between nature and social demands in the early years of life that endowed individuals with a characteristic stock of psychic responses, Erikson treated each stage as important in its own right. Working from the position that the ego had its own claims and was not necessarily at the mercy of the more powerful id and superego, Erikson contended that adolescence was not simply a consequence of Oedipal struggles but an important component of an ongoing process. Given Erikson’s insistence that identity was necessary to the feeling of being alive, one might conclude that the four prior stages led up to the crucial work of adolescence and the three subsequent ones expressed and expanded the identity that developed in adolescence. Coinciding with puberty and extending to roughly nineteen, adolescence compelled individuals to confront the tension between identity (a continuous and stable sense of one’s character, qualities, and goals) and role confusion (the inability to settle upon appropriate ways of being and achieve detente between self and society). Negotiating that tension meant integrating memories of what one had been in the past with anticipations of what one hoped to be in the future. The adolescent sense of self was particularly fragile since the adolescent was still uncertain of one’s physical and mental powers and intensely sensitive to how he or she appeared to others. If the task of identity is frustrated, one result was anti-social destructive behavior. As complicated as the stage could be --- something to which an increasing number of parents could attest --- most adolescents find an identity. Crucial to success was parental allowance for experimentation. Those who do open up space for a “moratorium,” Erikson advised, will generally find that their children have developed a full-blown identity in which they have reestablished boundaries and learned to negotiate a sometimes hostile world.
Although adolescence took place during a specific point in the life cycle and entailed finding identity, Erikson insisted that the content of adolescence varied from culture to culture, a point he developed further in his studies of Luther and Gandhi.[^42] Nature alone did not dictate how adolescence would be experienced or how the psychosocial conflict would be resolved. Drawing on his anthropological work, Erikson concluded that adolescence was best understood not as a single goal but rather as an experiment in constituting and reconstituting fragmentary selves. Because the purpose of identity was to help individuals adapt to historical change, there was never just one successful resolution of the identity crisis but a number of reasonable ones. The process would always be more or less tumultuous and change in the personality of the adolescent would always be slow in coming, yet it need not be as severe and disorienting as it was in the United States. Far too many American adolescents, the European Erikson asserted, were ill-equipped to be adults. Adolescence was particularly de-centering because of the American commitment to constant reinvention of the self in quest of singularity and the impermanence of institutions to guide transitions. Like many others in the late 1940s and 1950s, Erikson worried about the effects of mass society. He discerned that incessant preparation for success in a machine age of constant change turned supposedly independent Americans into followers who molded themselves in accord with the latest fashion. U.S. teenagers were particularly susceptible to being “overadjusted,” pushed to conformity and premature resolution of the psychosocial crisis by excessive social pressure, which he referred to as “a social jungle of human existence.” The culprit, Erikson charged, was “Mom” (punctuation in the original), a composite, stereotypical entity who managed her children’s lives, insisting on rigid moral behavior supposedly designed to help them become independent. Instead, such parenting had the effect of making teens feel abandoned at one level and guilty of abandoning their mothers at another.[^43]
Erikson endorsed Freud’s formula that a healthy self was capable of work and love but concentrated more on the former than the latter. Marynia Farnham and James Coleman, on the other hand, regarded adolescents as far too obsessed with love. Or at least sex. Both issued the now familiar charge that parents’ supervision was far too lax. Farnham’s _The Adolescent_ (1951) recognized that teenagers were caught between physical maturity and social prohibitions on their sexuality but instead of different mores or adolescent independence, she espoused stricter supervision. Iterating the position she took in her anti-feminist tract, _Modern Woman_ (1947), she excoriated women who “deserted the home for the supposedly more rewarding and exiting life of rivalry with men” and criticized parents who failed to enforce guidelines, believing that “youngsters can make all decisions for themselves and that uncurbed freedom is their right from birth on.”[^44] Whether increased parental supervision would resolve the conflict between physical development and social custom or clarify role confusion remained open questions.
Coleman’s _Adolescent Society_ (1961), which was based on his observation of ten Chicago-area high schools, concentrated on what he called the countercultural nature of adolescents. Walled off from the rest of society, teenagers so resembled one other that being a teenager outweighed differences in race, income, or geography. The culture that teenagers built was, Coleman insisted, revolved around trivial concerns and driven by peer pressure and minute attention to the judgment of others. These other-directed personalities in training were consumers par excellence, interested only in making the proper impression at sporting events and dances. Much to Coleman’s dismay, they cared little for academic success and relegated scholars to social marginality. Teen culture, Coleman concluded, even when not openly delinquent, was incompatible with preparation for adulthood or contribution to the community.[^45]
Coleman’s evidence suggested other interpretations, however. As sociologist Bennett Berger noted in an incisive 1963 review, Coleman missed much of the similarities between adolescents and their parents and misunderstood the goals that many adults had set for high school. Berger rightly noted that teenagers’ interest in cars, clothes, the opposite sex, and sports followed adults’ interest in those very same things. Football, he pointed out, had a better chance of creating community solidarity than academic achievements, which were too individualized and specialized to serve that purpose. Coleman missed plenty of evidence that the kids were not always countercultural. A majority of his respondents indicated that they preferred the parent-approved Pat Boone over Elvis Presley by a wide margin and claimed that they would rather risk breaking with a friend than earning their parents’ disapproval.[^46]
If Farnham and Coleman looked rather unsympathetically at teenagers’ efforts to find themselves, a trio of cultural critics did not. Best known to later generations was the anarchist critic and Gestalt therapist Paul Goodman. In _Growing Up Absurd_ (1960), Goodman argued, contra Coleman, that adults had too much control over adolescence. Rather than chaos, Goodman discerned conformity and training for regimented work, which he dismissed as “the organized system.” Schools, he charged, were factories of impulse suppression and sexual prudery. Given his Gestalt commitments, Goodman was especially opposed to selves divided from society. Youth institutions enforced boundaries, denying the young the chance to mold the world to their liking. Under such circumstances, Goodman argued, adulthood was mere adjustment and perpetual living with a perpetually constrained ego. Simply rejecting the American way of growing up was insufficient, Goodman maintained. The Beats earned his disapproval for their resignation and, while understanding of delinquents’ response, he nonetheless found them too fatalistic for his liking. Growing up with meaning, Goodman concluded, required reworking the world of love and work to encourage honesty, independence, and caring.
Edgar Z. Friedenberg, on the other hand, worried that American adolescence was not the moratorium that it was intended to be. His _Vanishing Adolescent_ (1959) lamented that rather than an Eriksonian time of experimentation and counterculture, the teenage years were contaminated by adult insistence that activities have socially acceptable ends. Unlike simple societies and lower-class subcultures, Friendenberg argued, intricate social organizations require an extended testing process so people can master roles. Individuals developed stable ego identities by setting themselves against the social order and becoming aware of “the complex, subtle, and precious difference between himself and his environment.”[^47] The _sturm und drang_ of adolescence might last yet lead teenagers to achieve a profound sense of self, Friedenberg asserted in one of the book’s more controversial passages, if they were free to acted as if they were aristocrats. He had in mind not so much imperiousness as self-assuredness. Adults were unlikely to allow such behavior but there was a model for safe aristocratic demeanor in British boarding schools, which gave “adolescents something to be adolescent about” in a relatively protected environment. American children, on the other hand, were provided experiences with the appearance of adulthood but none of the difficulties or unpleasantness. Rather than allowing disagreements to unfold properly, adult anxieties actively suppressed clashes. By treating all disagreement as unproductive, American society insured that growing up would result in few authentic individuals capable of deeply felt relationships with others.
Goodman and Friedenberg shared a dislike of other-directedness and consumerism for preventing independence and authenticity. Although praised for their emphasis on teenage initiative, both attracted criticism their partial portraits of the teenage condition. Critics charged they did far too little empirical observation, dwelt far too much on the pathologies of adolescence and all too often attributed them solely to adult actions. Then, as now, they were also criticized for making the male teenager the norm, a choice possibly a consequence of their own homosexuality. Women, Goodman insisted in the introduction, did not grow up absurd since they “will have children which is absolutely self-justifying, like any other natural or creative act.” Further, he went on in the introduction, the problems of teenage boys were “intensely interesting to women, for if the boys do not grow up to be men, where shall the women find men?”[^48]
Anthropologist Jules Henry, on the other hand, took girls’ problems seriously and provided a more detailed description of the problems of finding one’s self. The adolescence sections of his _Culture Against Man_ (1963), based on observations of St. Louis-area high schools, revealed how the essence of the teen years was insecurity. More than any other analyst, Henry captured the silent terror and constant confusion of adolescence. Writing with a socially aware Freudianism, Henry was sympathetic to the costs of the demands of the id, which were exaggerated by the constant mobility of American life. Because families moved so frequently, friendships, which would have enabled sublimation, were often unstable. Such instability resulted in an inadequacy felt on the prom dance floor and automobile backseats. Parental shortcomings lay less in the absence of discipline than in failure to establish and live out meaningful lives. This inability of adults to provide ego ideals, Henry argued, created a void that peers filled. Girls were especially affected in adolescence. The difficulty lay not so much in limited goals, since beauty, fashion and popularity struck him as legitimate and meaningful pursuits, as parental goading of girls into sexual competition to snare the right husband and condemnation of those who refused to compete.[^49]
Henry located another consequence of the lack of ego ideals in the aversion of teenagers to work. The example of “hard-working daddies” who are “little at home and burdened with the irritations, coronaries, and ulcers of their work” only underwrote pleasure-seeking behavior. Schools, too, were inadequate in setting meaningful ideals. In contrast to Coleman, Henry regarded school work as unchallenging and meaningless. Studying, especially when nagged to do so by parents, made Henry’s informants feel at the will of others. Promise of vague future benefits from school work only compounded the feeling. Yet because adolescents neither developed their own standards of success nor were involved in institutions in which the standards were meaningful to their talents or aspirations, grades loomed large in their education and work life. Grading met no needs, Henry claimed, but it did accustom students to accept impersonal, standardized norms as the best metric of self-worth. For the majority, this too was a recipe for feelings of inadequacy. Turning to pleasure seeking in response yielded little long-term gain and augured poorly for leaving adolescence with an Eriksonian “reward.”
The treatment of the adolescent search for self in expressive culture, while often sympathetic to the trials and tribulations of the young, was less Friedenberg than Farnham, less stories of change than fantasies of separatism. Although postwar art and fiction shared with earlier coming-of-age stories the conventions of a confused and unsettled protagonist and a distant and seemingly implacable social order, the novels and films of the mid-twentieth century departed from the models of the classic _bildungsroman_ and _kunstlerroman_. Those were novels of formation and growth of self. Narrated in the third person, connoting the objective truth of the situation, classic youth novels ended with the protagonists wiser and more understanding than when they began, their skills in negotiating the variability of life enhanced. Beginning their journey set against a society that seemingly had no place for them, they usually ended with a better sense of where they fit in and who they were. Their hard-won maturity enabled them to avoid repeating the mistakes of youth. Of the portrayal of adolescent crisis that were popular among subsequent generations (or at least teachers of subsequent generations), perhaps only John Knowles’s _Separate Peace_ (1959) harkened back to nineteenth-century traditions of character formation.
Much postwar depictions of adolescents, on the other hand, resisted conjuring up a viable or attractive version of maturity. Written in the first person or shot with a subjective camera, midcentury novels and films were statements of feeling, perceptions, and partial understandings of the narrator. Those viewpoints were partial and rarely broaden out to larger views. As titles such as _On the Road_ and _Rabbit Run_ indicate, postwar novels and films emphasized movement, not arrival. Their protagonists lack meaningful models and meaningful goals. The classic youth movies and novels often point to the romance of permanent adolescence. In highlighting their rejection of adult corruption and their own suffering, the teenagers of the classic postwar adolescent work of art treat their status as unique regardless of whether their acts truly warrant that designation. Even those characters whose lives are not particularly angst-ridden, like the protagonist of Saul Bellow’s picaresque novel, _The Adventures of Augie March_ (1953), lack a sense of purpose and commitment. March’s tale takes him from one thing to another, from Chicago poolrooms and Mexican deserts to service in the Merchant Marine and a sketchy postwar European business career. March is optimistic rather than morose. He imagines himself a “sort of Columbus” having before him an “immediate terra incognita that spreads out in every gaze.” Yet he shares with other adolescent protagonists a lack of overarching goals, deep held commitments, or truly stable or affectionate relationships with others.
Despite its reputation, Nicholas Ray’s _Rebel Without a Cause_ (1955), a film depicting twenty-four hours in the life of troubled teenager Jim Stark, was less rebellious than conservative. Known for James Dean’s star turn in which he combined daring, anger, pain, and an expressive adolescent inarticulateness, the movie often seemed like Farnham in Technicolor. Jim’s parents never make him face the consequences of his behavior, moving to a new school every time he has a brush with the law or fails to make friend. When he tries to take responsibility for the death of a rival during a “chickie run,” a race in two stolen cars towards a cliff that is won by being the last to jump out, his parents attempt to dissuade him, much to his disgust. At the heart of Jim’s teen angst is the gender trouble all around him. His cold and demanding mother clearly dominates his father, who backs down in nearly every argument rather than live with unpleasantness. His father (Jim Backus) so obviously lacks the proper masculinity that he wears an apron over his suit while doing household chores (a particular warning sign in a period committed to a clear and obvious sexual division of roles, which Ray emphasized by making it a particularly frilly full-length one). He does not, and apparently cannot, answer Jim’s constant question about what one has to do to be a man. The lack of guidance drives Jim to complain that his father just wants to be his pal. He goes so far as to hope his dad would haul off and hit his mother just once and set things straight. No one, he concludes, could grow up in a circus like that. His parents’ mixed messages, he howls after being brought to jail for public drunkenness, are tearing him apart. He is not the only teen who has parents who fail to fulfill their proper gender roles. Judy (Natalie Wood), whose efforts to kiss her father are greeted with pushes and slaps, and Plato (Sal Mineo), a boy coded as gay whose father fled his family, end up in an abandoned mansion where they play fantasy family with quite traditional roles. A showdown leads to Plato’s death and Jim’s parents mistakenly believe the dead boy was their son. Learning otherwise, Jim’s dad vows to be a better father, restoring the family to its proper patriarchal form. That, in turn, allows Jim a proper relationship with Judy.
The allure of permanent adolescence was part of the long-standing appeal of J. D. Salinger’s novel _Catcher in the Rye_ (1951). In his moral insistence and emotional vulnerability, Holden Caulfield exemplifies the traits that made teenagers both fascinating and exasperating. Holden is prone to maudlin displays of concern and tremendous remorse (apparent in his trek through Central Park to find where the ducks go in winter and his subsequent breaking the record bought for his sister Phoebe), indifferent to school and achievement, and drawn to such unrealistic plans as living in the wilderness. Although superficially aware of adult practices (drinking in night clubs, going to Broadway plays, staying alone in a hotel), Holden is nonetheless uncomfortable with adult status. He fails to lose his virginity despite his efforts in part because he is deeply ambivalent about sexuality, often treating any trace as an unwarranted aggression on the innocence and generosity of children. He recoils at obscene graffiti on the merry - go- round and imagines himself as the protector of the purity of children, the person who catches children playing an unspecified game in a rye field on the edge of a cliff. Rejecting the advice of a former teacher that an immature man wishes to die of a noble cause while a mature one hopes to live humbly for one, Holden envies the stasis of the Eskimos in the diorama at the Natural History museum, wishing that he too could stay the same forever.
Holden’s indictment of adulthood is among the best-known parts of the book. Almost everyone who has read it --- whether he or she admires him for his truth telling or recoils from his whininess --- remembers his tendency to label others (and at times himself) as “phony.” The phrase became part of the lexicon of midcentury because it pithily encapsulated the postwar concern with authenticity and the representative role of adolescents in feeling their way toward it. Phonies cheat at the Eriksonian task of balancing self-expression with social involvement. They adopt socially acceptable behavior not from commitment but for material and personal gain. Their concern for others derives from their sense that such gestures are social expected. Holden applies the word to such disparate examples of metropolitan life as his roommate Stradlater who exploits his dates, the headmaster who insincerely greets odd-looking parents, and patrons who cheer wildly for the Rockettes’ precision dancing, Lunt-Fontaine performances, and the nightclub pianist Ernie’s predictable flourishes. Adults might well judge the insincerity in dealing with others a more serious (if sometimes necessary) offense than the exercise of bad taste. In Holden’s world, however, both insincerity and lack of aesthetic discrimination are equally products of a social world of artifice and manipulation in which spontaneity, joy, kindness, and wholeness are absent. Holden, in contrast, champions an authentic world in which people act as they really are.
As committed as he is to authenticity, Holden is still very much a vulnerable adolescent. Protecting his faint sense of who he really is often leads him into actions that are themselves phony. As he himself admits, he is “the most terrific liar you ever saw.” Indeed, he dissembles constantly. Some lies are designed to conform to social norms as when he tells the mother of the “biggest bastard that ever went to Pency” that her son is both popular and modest because he thinks she is nice and does not want to puncture her illusions. Other lies are cruel, as when he punishes the shallow women from Seattle by telling them they just missed seeing the actor Gary Cooper. Still other falsehoods deflect attention away from Holden’s actual situation. Personal communication is fraught for Holden because it risks bringing up painful memories of his brother Allie’s death and exacerbating his uneasiness with himself. It is also fraught because Holden possesses enough self-awareness to realize his own propensity for phoniness. Locked in the dilemma, all he can imagine is going West and living as a deaf mute. Alienation, normally an obstacle to coming to terms with oneself and one’s feelings, is here the guarantor of authenticity and the protector of identity against change and social expectations. The enduring popularity of the novel among adults suggests, perhaps, a desire to jettison adulthood from the liminal state of adolescence. The depth of the identification with the novel had led some to talk of adolescence as a kind of ethnicity.
Critics have touted Sylvia Plath’s novel _The_ _Bell Jar_ (1963) as the female version of _Catcher_, and the similarities are clear. Plath’s protagonist, Esther Greenwood, shares with Holden Caulfield a profound alienation from the adult world and from herself. Like him, she judges others as inauthentic and has no sense of what she wants to be. The publication history of the books paralleled each other. Both were turned down by the publishers that originally commissioned their work, with Salinger’s editor telling him that he could not tell if Holden was supposed to be crazy or not and Plath’s labeling hers “disappointing, juvenile, and overwrought.” Both authors were thought to identify with their lead characters. Although famously a recluse, Salinger did try to peddle a stage version with the provision that he play Holden. Plath drew many of the details from her own life and committed suicide shortly after the British publication.
Yet the social world that Esther finds so oppressive is only partially the one that Holden believes is filled with phonies. The inauthenticity that Plath details takes on a special complexion because it is women’s roles that Esther finds so oppressive. Winner of a prestigious summer internship at a New York woman’s magazine, _Ladies Day_, Esther is unmoved by what other girls would have regarded as a dream chance, feeling only “still and empty”(2). Unlike her fellow interns, she rejects traditional goals. When asked what she wants to be, she can only manage that she doesn’t know. Female identity as conventionally advanced repels her. She compares marriage and children rearing to being “brainwashed”: “you went about numb as a slave in some private totalitarian state” (81). Childbirth is akin to being trapped in a “long, blind, doorless and windowless corridor of pain” (p. 62). The double standard infuriates her. She labels her boyfriend Buddy a “hypocrite” when he admits he is not a virgin and breaks off their engagement. Losing her virginity to a tall but not very good-looking mathematician in Cambridge leads to hemorrhaging and a trip to the hospital. In short, she regards the female existence as being under a bell jar --- an image she uses to describe her own empty, airless, suspended experience but applies later to the college girls who play bridge, gossip and study. Her ability to see the bell jar that others do not establishes her distinctive perception while pointing to a common condition for women.
Esther’s lack of traditional feminine desires prompts her to undertake an unsuccessful search for meaning. Her quest to be a writer comes to naught when she is rejected for a summer class at Harvard taught by a famous writer. Finding nothing satisfying, she veers toward a madness that liberates her from the social imperatives imposed upon middle-class women, but which also risks obliterating the internal self altogether. Where Holden aspires to be isolated or in a perpetual adolescent state, Esther struggles simply to be able to say “I am.” At times she feels a zombie inside her, preventing her from speaking or writing, convinced that her deteriorating penmanship is the sign of insanity she needs to hide from her doctor. Her suicide attempts fail because she is convinced that her body will not obey her mind. Where traditionally the mind (or head) has been regarded as the scene of the self, Esther experiences what Abigail Cheever has called “a profound disintegration” in which her body and her mind are not working in tandem; her rationality gone, her existence is affirmed by the acts of her body. Contending that it has “little tricks,” she sets as her goal escaping being “trapped in its stupid cage for fifty years” left “without any sense at all” (153).
As her disintegration worsens, Esther enters treatment with an arrogant, self-absorbed and unfeeling male psychiatrist who subjects her to electroshock therapy. Walking out, rather than endure more hellish torture, she continues her efforts at suicide. Eventually she comes close enough to succeeding by taking fifty sleeping pills at once and hiding in her cellar, which results in her confinement in a private hospital. There, after a successful electroshock treatment and an empathetic therapy with a female doctor, she finally comes to a tenuous and fragile grip on normality, being able to say at a funeral of a friend who successfully committed suicide, “I am, I am, I am,” which she ascribes to “the old brag of my heart.” Where her mother insists she treat her illness as if it were a bad dream, she counters to herself that she cannot since it was part of her. By retaining a sense of her madness, Esther emphasizes her distance from social roles, even as she prepares to be released into the social world and lead what others might term a normal existence. Yet the content of her character remains sketchy at best. Nor is it certain that she will not try suicide again. As such, Esther Greenwood serves as a stark example of how fragile the success of finding oneself had become.
