Abstract

Comment
Permissiveness — not as unbridled hedonism but rather free from moral baggage, loosening of traditional constraints [older meaning]

NeoFreudians and Rogers in particular as more like Tocqueville’s Americans — belief in perfection.

Points to psychotropic drugs, particularly Miltown, which do not require any introspection (25), the disease notion of alcoholism; Liebman’s Peace of Mind — Spock very conservative gender roles but on discipline, peer group interaction, and innate goodness.
Moral rebellion not from the cultural fringe — came from within mainstream Spock, Mann (medicalization of alcoholism) secular theology — simply less sin, guilt, or shame.

Bingo controversy; pastoral counseling.

{Petigny, 2009, #98002@105}   Sexual revolution key to his thesis. If there was indeed a dramatic loosening of values at midcentury — if Americans by the tens of millions were adopting a less traditional stance on fundamental moral questions, then surely we should be able to identify a significant upswing in premarital sex during the Eisenhower years.

{Petigny, 2009, #98002@106}   Between 1940 and 1960, the frequency of single motherhood among white women increased more than 2.5 fold rising from 3.6 newborns to 9.2 newborns per 1,000 unmarried women of childbearing age. Among all women, single motherhood rose from 7.1 newborns to 21.6 newborns per 1,000 women of childbearing age.

Premarital pregnancy rate measures both single mothers and mothers married but unmarried at the time of coitus.
Playboy Interview began in 1962.

Points out that noncompliance with norms (girls were not virgins but did not admit it to others) become frequent enough for long enough 00 one of three possible outcomes will ensue— the norm will be enfeebled, eroding the stigma or social sanctions associated with violating the norm will be modified; r the norm will eventually be replaced. [in this case, behavior anticipated sexualization of culture. Likewise with “shotgun marriages” which increase. Moral state of affairs in upheaval at the beginning of the Cold War years. More single women were becoming pregnant and more children born out of wedlock. A higher proportion of single men were marrying their pregnant girlfriends. [Not sure why some norms abided by and others ignored.] Single Motherhood in blacks predates the causes most liberal and conservative scholars have regarded as preeminent. [well not Moynihan]

Most criticism of 1950s gender roles based on conventional wisdom or anecdote 

Lundberg and Farnham contend independence against female nature — those who refuse to marry or have children were attempting to resolve some psychological trauma that they had experienced during their childhood.

Self realization could take place within home — homemakers, he claims, are dismissed in the historical literature — changing attitudes not necessarily dependent upon employment status (168).
{Petigny, 2009, #98002@173} It would seem that the importance of the 1960s rested less in its success in changing the hearts and minds of the general public than in its ability to mobilize a new generation of committed feminist leaders. In periodizing the rise of feminism in post-World War II America, the fifties should be imagined as a time when attitudes toward women were steadily changing; the sixties as primarily a period of organization-building and antidiscriminatory legislation and the seventies as the decade when the feminist revolution came into full bloom.
“Although partially true, these explanations are incomplete because they fail to appreciate the important changes that were occurring within the domestic realm, the religious sphere, the therapist’s office, and the college classroom.” {Petigny, 2009, #98002@175}

Change in women’s attitudes coming from Middle America. The primary challenge to the subservience of women came not from the culture’s periphery but from its very core, not from pockets of resistance but from the larger culture. {Petigny, 2009, #98002@177}

Vance Packard testified before Congress warning against Rock n roll.

Macdonald’s New Yorker article 29 November 1958 praises Boone; wants to argue that Boone’s appeal was sexual too — Yeah, but rock ’n’ roll didn’t have a monopoly on that; It didn’t begin in the 1950s or even the 1930s. The question is the kind of appeal. C’mon: “The sexual innuendo occurring in Boone’s lyrics, and his ability as a marquee performer to introduce thousands of fans to other rock ’n’ roll act, abetted the forces of liberalization.” {Petigny, 2009, #98002@186}

Surely the issue is the hysterical reaction to blue jeans and rock ’n’ roll. Now seems so tame — destruction that was supposed to follow clearly did not.

Late 1950s change in attitudes about going steady. Teenage hostility seen as experimentation; healthy development, anti-conformist (215). [Even Pat Boone indicated he had a delinquent past, revealed so people wouldn’t think he was a “sissy.” Which means that was how he was regarded? No? Mischief had become independence. {Petigny, 2009, #98002@217}

  Although young men did not wish to totally cast off the values of the older generation, they did not see themselves — nor did they want to be seen by others — as ‘goody-two shoes’ or as the passive creations of their elders.” No generation gap because adults briskly changing from traditional morality also.

Glamorization of youth — adult fans of Dick Clark and Mad Magazine
Authenticity, self-actualization. Greater emphasis on self-mastery rather than self-expression. Rejection of the belief in the innate depravity of mankind, celebration of spontaneity and the pronounced turn toward self-awareness.

Overstreet’s Mature Mind challenges original sin notion, complains St. Augustine denied human beings the “the healthy blessing of self respect”

Niebuhr does have some positive things to say — Sin is a corruption of man’s true essence but not its destruction. . . . Fall had not transformed the world into an entirely depraved and evil realm. Noted human creativity, which like sin, came from human anxiety. So less depraved than traditional Christian view; no renunciation of the things of this world,

Abstract expressionism privileges the unpremeditated act — Belgrad. Spontaneous moment tap into the vast resources of subconscious in a creative act of improvisation.

Maslow — pure spontaneity consists of free, uninhibited expression of the self, i.e., of the psychiatric forces with minimal interference by consciousness. Control, will, caution, self-criticism, measure, deliberativeness, are the breaks upon this.” spontaneity equals autonomous and self-actualized because meant possessing the ability to act naturally, without regard to stifling social conventions, or having to rely on self-censorship.
Maslow thinks all external elements lost authority including prosperity and democracy. Leaves only self. Rogers celebrates individuals who do not depend on the judgment of others or their past behavior or upon guiding principles. Based on what feels right as competent guide to behavior which is truly satisfying.
Need American fiction in the Cold war. Pelagianism heresy — self became what one made of it. proof of sensitivity appreciating others.

Gandhi as hero —celebrated as an alternative to the calculating, repressive worldview. {Petigny, 2009, #98002@244}

Citing La Pierre contrast between stated refusal to serve Chinese and actual behavior. “pressures to conform probably contributed to the normative gap. To the extent the 1950s were a time of social conformity, the compelling need of Americans to fit in only helped widen the breach between norms and values. In trying to adhere to the conservative, middle-class ideal, millions of Americans at midcentury did exactly what they were supposed to: they flocked en masse to suburbia, begat large families, regularly attended church, and eschewed radical politics [so for all of what’s gone on before this on page 255, we’re back at the beginning]. However, in those private corners of their lives that are not easily scrutinized by prying parents or nosy neighbors — in their personal attitudes toward sex, parenting, or religion — more and more Americans were personally rejecting a traditionally conservative moral framework.

??? Thinks authorities and experts may has sense changes but missed full magnitude. So they tightened social conventions, which further widened gap between values and norms. 1960s was a closing the gap, resolving a discrepancy — which explains, of course, why it was so easy.???

Jews!!! less rural, more educated, and increasingly white collar — country is becoming more like Jews. Limited by belief in evil and the importance of community. And therefore a limit on introspection and individualism.
