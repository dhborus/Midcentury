Running on empty

Need to bear the following in mind.[@whitfield2000]:

-- autocomplete.bibtex works on .md files. But has problems setting up after closing. Not sure particularly how to fix.[@whitfield2000]

-- Git Hub sometimes does not register changes. Not sure why. Close pane and then control-shift-9

Important to work with notes and projects properly.[@wilmer2008, p. 16]
