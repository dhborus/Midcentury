#  Chapter Four:

### The Decentered Search for the Centered Self
\
\
Just before he lights out for Europe, the narrator-protagonist of James Baldwin’s *Giovanni’s Room* (1956), David, muses that he did so because he “wanted to find myself.” He regards that desire as peculiarly American, noting that the phrase is neither current “in the language of any other people” and “certainly does not mean what it says but betrays a nagging suspicion that something has been misplaced.” The sojourn to the Old World does little to render David’s desires, inclinations, and capacities legible or stable. Unable to accept his homosexual longings, particularly for the titular character whom he abandons in the face of his conviction and execution for murder, David ends alienated from his very physical being, baffled when looking in the mirror by “what moves in this body” and for “what this body is searching.”[@baldwin1956, p. 39, 189]

Contemporary critics found fault not only with the novel's unapologetic treatment of homosexuality but also its lack of coverage of black life and accused Baldwin of decadence and elitism. They missed, however, the central contention of Baldwin's fiction and nonfiction alike: the race problem originated in whites' inability to know themselves. Baldwin was only one of many artists and scholars who held that postwar American society made it difficult for Americans to develop a firm sense of who they were, allow consistent personal expression or reliably foster expanded capacities. As the leading exemplar of modernity, the United States was, the argument went, especially prone to psychic upheavals and fragmentation despite the often placid exterior of its citizens. Writing in 1962, the husband and wife team Mary and Eric Josephson laid blame for such psycho-social disorders as loss of self, anxiety states, despair, rootlessness, apathy, meaninglessness, and loss of beliefs and values on the absence of meaningful communities and interpersonal relations. Other commentators blamed corporate bureaucracy, advertising, and a wide array of institutional demands for conformity such as schools and the media. [@josephson1962. Popular contemporary criticisms of American life include John Keats, *The Crack in the Picture Window* (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1957); @whyte1956; and  @packard1957. Two by Daniel Horowitz examine the genre: *Vance Packard & American Social Criticism* (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 1994) and *The Anxieties of Affluence: Critiques of American Consumer Culture, 1939-1979* (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 2004).]

Postwar concern about the insubstantiality of selves quickly assumed a political cast. Material and objective causes did not, most analysts contended, fully explanation popular support for Fascist and Communist regimes.  Mass intolerance and antidemocratic movements were best explained by psychosocial abnormalities. Erich Fromm's *Escape from Freedom* (1941), Theodor Adorno's *Authoritarian Personality* (1950), and Hannah Arendt's *Origin of Totalitarianism* all attributed totalitarian success to the ability of ruling groups to manipulate unfulfilled psychological needs. Although fascist and communist ideologies had little appeal to most Americans, many commentators nonetheless worried that a society of anomic individuals who lacked internalized standards were fodder for poseurs and demagogues. That possibility no doubt fanned an interest in Tocqueville's argument that democracy produced citizens who sought safety i a culture of stifling uniformity and who were capable of massing against those who were distinctive or different.[@mcclay1994 contains a useful summary of the tendency to explain political phenomena by psycho-social factors. It is noteworthy perhaps that all three and the philosopher Jacob Talmon, author of *The Origins of Totalitarian Democracy* (Boston: Beacon Press, 1952), were Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany.] Augmenting the theoretical work of the social critics was that of social psychologists in a series of experiments Solomon Asch and Stanley Milgram obtained results that suggested most individuals lacked the psychological assuredness to resist a relentless majority or a demanding, unfeeling authority. Asch (1951, 1956) observed that subjects more often than not acceded to the group truth, even when it countered their own perceptions. For his part, Milgram discovered that most people would continue to punish others when ordered to do so. There was, many observers concluded a "Good German" in all of us.[The pertinent studies are @asch1951; @asch1956; and @milgram1963. For a discussion of the implications for the social psychology of postwar politics, see *Critical Psychology: An Introduction*, Dennis Fox and Isaac Prilleltensky, editors (London: Sage, 1997) and Israel Charny, *Fascism and Democracy in the Human Mind: A Bridge between Mind and Society* (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2006)]

In meeting the growing weight of expectations placed on the self, Americans increasingly looked to psychological discourse or therapy rather than religion or philosophy, as would have been the case in the past. Where once Americans examined the state of their souls, their postwar counterparts more often than not turned their attention to their mental and emotional makeup. Emblematic of the shift was Rabbi Joshua Liebman's best-selling *Peace of Mind* (1947), which blended Talmudic wisdom with Freudian insight and a new popular advice literature, spearheaded by Ann Landers and Abigail Van Buren, that substituted psychological discernment for the old conduct of life bromides.[^5] Five times as many doctorates in psychology were awarded in the 1950s as the decade before. The number of psychiatrists increased ten fold from 1939 to 1959.[@scull2010]  Those numbers do not include the tremendous growth in psychological-based pastoral counseling. With numbers came a new prestige. Robert Linder’s *Fifty-Minute Hour* (1955) was indicative of the midcentury tendency to extol the psychiatrist as seer and depth psychology as the royal road to understanding motivation -- a tendency that informed a spate of movies ranging from Alfred Hitchcock's *Spellbound* (1945) to John Houston's *Freud* (1962). Small wonder, then, that *Life* Magazine hailed the 1950s as the "Age of Psychology."[^7]

Efforts in the "Age of Psychology" to find the foundations of a secure and stable self proceeded along a number of dimensions. Although Freud and Freudian discourse and therapies garnered great attention, they by no means had a monopoly. Personality testing, which gained great popularity in business and schools with its promise of matching people with jobs and mates with which they were best suited, owed much to Carl Jung's *Psychological Types* (1923).[The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator was the leading tool for categorizing and sorting people during the mid-twentieth century. @emre2018] For all the emphasis on thought, feeling, and inclination, biological determinism remained a crucial component of the search for a centered self. A number of investigators pinned their hopes on deciphering the somatic basis of selfhood. Others pondered the proper relationship between the self and others. At stake was whether society was too pressing on individuals or whether social bonds were too insubstantial and evanescent. The two concerns merged in one of the key worries of postwar American life, the nature of teenagers. A period of changing bodies and role testing, the teenage years proved fertile ground for theorists and artists alike.

**Body and Self**
\

Although the proliferating psychological currents differed widely over whether the self was inborn and inherent or more undeveloped and open to construction and reconstruction, most held that the self was an ethereal rather than material entity. Selfhood was primarily understood as a matter of conceptions, ideas, and spirit, the awareness of one's unique qualities and capacities. Even those aspects of the self that were clearly generated by the needs of the body -- food, sleep, sex -- were, because they were universal, treated more as stimuli that the self processed and shaped rather than a determinant of selfhood.


Later generations have tended to regard the mid-twentieth century as a time in which Americans held rigid views of the relationship between self and its physical housing. Conventional wisdom, the story goes, insisted that a mature self recognized the biological imperatives of being human, accepted distinct and natural roles that suited one's body, and restrained and mastered bodily impulses. There were indeed plenty of injunctions against sexual expressions ranging from masturbation to homosexuality and a slew of strictures regarding proper gender roles. It is, however, salutary to recall that there were plenty challenges to the pat links between body and self. Freudians, for instance, warned that repression led to psychic damage that was, in any event, bound to fail.


[^5]: On the prominence of psychological discourse, see Alan Petigny, *The Permissive Society: America, 1941-1965* (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2009), 15-99 and @herman19952. The traditional argument holds that psychology and the therapeutic undercut religious strictures about holy and sanctified behavior by elevating psychic peace and adjustment. See [@rieff1966] and [@meyer1965]. [@stevens2010] has challenged the interpretation, ontending that the turn to psychology was a complex and serious achievement of Protestant modernism, not reducible to simplistic pop psychological extrapolations.

[^7]: The *Life* series, written by Ernest Havemen, ran over five issues, kicking off on January 7, 1957. Included were discussions of psychological testing, the use of psychology in the workplace, psychoanalysis, and the future of psychology.
