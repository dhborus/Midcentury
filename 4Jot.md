#  Chapter Four:

### The De-centered Search for the Centered Self
\
\
Just before he lights out for Europe, the narrator-protagonist of James Baldwin’s *Giovanni’s Room* (1956), David, muses that he did so because he “wanted to find myself.” He regards that desire as peculiarly American, noting that the phrase is neither current “in the language of any other people” and “certainly does not mean what it says but betrays a nagging suspicion that something has been misplaced.” The sojourn to the Old World does little to render David’s desires, inclinations, and capacities legible or stable. Unable to accept his homosexual longings, particularly for the titular character whom he abandons in the face of his conviction and execution for murder, David ends alienated from his very physical being, baffled when looking in the mirror by “what moves in this body” and for “what this body is searching.”[@baldwin1956, p. 39, 189]

Contemporary critics found fault not only with the novel's unapologetic treatment of homosexuality but also its lack of coverage of black life and accused Baldwin of decadence and elitism. They missed, however, the central contention of Baldwin's fiction and nonfiction alike: the race problem originated in whites' inability to know themselves. Baldwin was only one of many artists and scholars who held that postwar American society made it difficult for Americans to develop a firm sense of who they were, allow consistent personal expression or reliably foster expanded capacities. As the leading exemplar of modernity, the United States was, the argument went, especially prone to psychic upheavals and fragmentation despite the often placid exterior of its citizens. Writing in 1962, the husband and wife team Mary and Eric Josephson laid blame for such psycho-social disorders as loss of self, anxiety states, despair, rootlessness, apathy, meaninglessness, and loss of beliefs and values on the absence of meaningful communities and interpersonal relations. Other commentators blamed corporate bureaucracy, advertising, and a wide array of institutional demands for conformity such as schools and the media. [@josephson1962. Popular contemporary criticisms of American life include John Keats, *The Crack in the Picture Window* (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1957); @whyte1956; and  @packard1957. Two by Daniel Horowitz examine the genre: *Vance Packard & American Social Criticism* (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 1994) and *The Anxieties of Affluence: Critiques of American Consumer Culture, 1939-1979* (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 2004).]

Postwar concern about the insubstantiality of selves quickly assumed a political cast. Material and objective causes did not, most analysts contended, fully explanation popular support for Fascist and Communist regimes.  Mass intolerance and antidemocratic movements were best explained by psychosocial abnormalities. Erich Fromm's *Escape from Freedom* (1941), Theodor Adorno's *Authoritarian Personality* (1950), and Hannah Arendt's *Origin of Totalitarianism* all attributed totalitarian success to the ability of ruling groups to manipulate unfulfilled psychological needs. Although fascist and communist ideologies had little appeal to most Americans, many commentators nonetheless worried that a society of anomic individuals who lacked internalized standards were fodder for poseurs and demagogues. That possibility no doubt fanned an interest in Tocqueville's argument that democracy produced citizens who sought safety i a culture of stifling uniformity and who were capable of massing against those who were distinctive or different.[@mcclay1994 contains a useful summary of the tendency to explain political phenomena by psycho-social factors. It is noteworthy perhaps that all three and the philosopher Jacob Talmon, author of *The Origins of Totalitarian Democracy* (Boston: Beacon Press, 1952), were Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany.] Augmenting the theoretical work of the social critics was that of social psychologists in a series of experiments Solomon Asch and Stanley Milgram obtained results that suggested most individuals lacked the psychological assuredness to resist a relentless majority or a demanding, unfeeling authority. Asch (1951, 1956) observed that subjects more often than not acceded to the group truth, even when it countered their own perceptions. For his part, Milgram discovered that most people would continue to punish others when ordered to do so. There was, many observers concluded a "Good German" in all of us.[The pertinent studies are @asch1951; @asch1956; and @milgram1963. For a discussion of the implications for the social psychology of postwar politics, see *Critical Psychology: An Introduction*, Dennis Fox and Isaac Prilleltensky, editors (London: Sage, 1997) and Israel Charny, *Fascism and Democracy in the Human Mind: A Bridge between Mind and Society* (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2006)]

In meeting the growing weight of expectations placed on the self, Americans increasingly looked to psychological discourse or therapy rather than religion or philosophy, as would have been the case in the past. Where once Americans examined the state of their souls, their postwar counterparts more often than not turned their attention to their mental and emotional makeup. Emblematic of the shift was Rabbi Joshua Liebman's best-selling *Peace of Mind* (1947), which blended Talmudic wisdom with Freudian insight and a new popular advice literature, spearheaded by Ann Landers and Abigail Van Buren, that substituted psychological discernment for the old conduct of life bromides.[^5] Five times as many doctorates in psychology were awarded in the 1950s as the decade before. The number of psychiatrists increased ten fold from 1939 to 1959.[@scull2010]  Those numbers do not include the tremendous growth in psychological-based pastoral counseling. With numbers came a new prestige. Robert Linder’s *Fifty-Minute Hour* (1955) was indicative of the midcentury tendency to extol the psychiatrist as seer and depth psychology as the royal road to understanding motivation -- a tendency that informed a spate of movies ranging from Alfred Hitchcock's *Spellbound* (1945) to John Houston's *Freud* (1962). Small wonder, then, that *Life* Magazine hailed the 1950s as the "Age of Psychology."[^7]

Efforts in the "Age of Psychology" to find the foundations of a secure and stable self proceeded along a number of dimensions. Although Freud and Freudian discourse and therapies garnered great attention, they by no means had a monopoly. Personality testing, which gained great popularity in business and schools with its promise of matching people with jobs and mates with which they were best suited, owed much to Carl Jung's *Psychological Types* (1923).[The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator was the leading tool for categorizing and sorting people during the mid-twentieth century. @emre2018] For all the emphasis on thought, feeling, and inclination, biological determinism remained a crucial component of the search for a centered self. A number of investigators pinned their hopes on deciphering the somatic basis of selfhood. Others pondered the proper relationship between the self and others. At stake was whether society was too pressing on individuals or whether social bonds were too insubstantial and evanescent. The two concerns merged in one of the key worries of postwar American life, the nature of teenagers. A period of changing bodies and role testing, the teenage years proved fertile ground for theorists and artists alike.

**Body and Self**
\
\
Although the proliferating psychological currents differed widely over whether the self was inborn and inherent or more undeveloped and open to construction and reconstruction, most held that the self was an ethereal rather than material entity. Selfhood was primarily understood as a matter of conceptions, ideas, and spirit, the awareness of one's unique qualities and capacities. Even those aspects of the self that were clearly generated by the needs of the body -- food, sleep, sex -- were, because they were universal, treated more as stimuli that the self processed and shaped rather than a determinant of selfhood. Nonetheless, biological determinism hardly vanished from American cultural and intellectual life. Not only did explanations for the self rooted in the type of body one possessed enable commentators to locate a center in human nature, talk of a biological foundation, as Nadine Weidman has observed, had the advantage of providing a challenge to Soviet claims to be building the new human.[@weidman2012]

No one was as insistent that the self was a function of body as psychologist William Sheldon (1898-1977). The godson of William James, Sheldon drew upon post-Mendelian modern genetics with its emphasis on multiple determinants of traits to lay out an elaborate form of somatic classification. His scheme rated physiques along scales that ran from one to seven based of their sphericality, muscularity and linearity, which allowed Sheldon to assign each body a three-digit number. Sheldon maintained that somatotypes did not change over time, even with weight change. He took a similar approach with personality, ranking on the basis of sixty traits that he claimed originated in bodily need and which fell into clusters around relaxation, muscular activity involving action and power, and restraint and inhibition. People with prominent guts (endomorphs) craved relaxation and pampering---both somatic and psychological. Muscle-bound men were driven toward action and power and took little note of others, and so on. Although Sheldon conceded both that traits could appear in different forms and that there were numerous cases in which morphologies did not match with manifest temperaments, he never doubted physique was destiny. Not surprisingly, somatotypers were prone to snap judgments. Physical anthropologist Carl Seltzer breezily contended that weak (effeminate by his lights) body types (about 15% of the white, male population) were likely to lack psychic energy, proper motivation, sociability, and appropriate values. Sheldon applauded the 1-7-2 body (which had the highest muscularity and little sphericality or linearity) as the “incarnation of a heroic ideal,” the “masculine ideal of warlike and conquesting people,” the “American eagle of somatotypes” and claimed that the type was most often found in those who traced their heritage to Anglo-Saxon countries. His animal analogies for other categories were less complimentary.[^10]

Sheldon’s overt racism, support for eugenics, and ornery personality initially proved no obstacle to widespread acceptance of his “science.” Tapping the desire for grounded and knowable self, Sheldon's contention that the self was a consequence of its bodily form lay people and professionals alike a way to comprehend and classify the seeming diversity of human behavior and inclinations. Magazines ran such articles as “What Manner of Morph Are You?” and “How Your Shape Shapes Your Life.” Psychologists subjected numerous Ivy League freshmen to nude photographing sessions and psychological probing when arriving on campus. By the mid-1950s, however, Sheldonism was under critical scrutiny. Detractors charged he mixed causation with correlation, ignored changes in body type, offered “just so” stories as explanations, and had failed to produce convincing results despite years of measuring. His research assistant simply confirmed what critics suspected when she claimed he fudged his classifications so that body and personality type meshed.[^11]

Alfred Kinsey’s approach to the body-self relation has proven more politically and intellectually credible than Sheldon’s. A biologist who claimed to have no vested interest in the outcome, he undertook his famous reports on human sexual behavior as “first of all a report on what people do, which raises no question of what they should do.” Kinsey and his associates obtained data that previous investigators had not on such seemingly taboo acts as masturbation, homosexual contact, and non-marital intercourse through innovative interview techniques. The results were surprising to many. Acts thought rare and often morally out of bounds turned out to be fairly common. Taken together, the non-heterosexual, non-marital acts outnumbered marital ones. Given individuals in a variety of different acts, Kinsey classified people not dichotomously but along a spectrum. One was not gay or straight but engaged in primarily one or both acts. Taking a decidedly amoral and biological position, Kinsey dismissed the views of those who regarded some acts immoral, criticizing those who did not “want to believe that there are gradations in these matters from one to the other extreme.”[^12] For Kinsey, all acts were undertaken for sexual release, or “outlet,” and were biologically commensurate. In subsequent years, detractors criticized his emphasis on outlet for its assumption of a male norm of sexuality, but the measure also allowed Kinsey to challenge the belief that the vaginal orgasm was the ultimate female sexual experience and to worry that women were not achieving outlet on par with men.

Kinsey’s work struck a chord. Published by a small medical press, the *Reports* became best-sellers. The male version (1948) sold nearly 250,000 copies and its female counterpart (1954) eventually surpassed that figure. Americans had become, in the expression of the day, “Kinsey conscious.” Kinsey himself assumed celebrity status, mentioned in Cole Porter’s “Too Darn Hot” from *Kiss Me, Kate*. The reports spurred unprecedented public talk about sex and raised questions about what was normal. Many readers indicated to Kinsey that they sought reassurance by checking his charts and graphs to determine where they fell on his scales. Other readers had more pressing concerns. Haunted by urges and acts often deemed abnormal, many wrote to Kinsey for advice and help. Whether his reassurances soothed their troubles, he forthrightly articulated to those who felt outside the pale that conventional standards were arbitrary, not natural, and need not govern their self-understanding.

Debate over the reports was especially fierce. Lay critics accused Kinsey of encouraging immoral and harmful behavior. Academics concentrated primarily on his methodology and his assumptions. His sample was less diverse than he implied. His American data hardly allowed for generalization to males or females in general. Even as a measure of the United States, the data were limited. As a number of critics noted at the time, his surveys over-represented some groups (whites, middle-class women) and under-represented or excluded others (African Americans were, for reasons Kinsey never made clear, excluded from the volume on female sexual behavior). To survey lower-class men (Kinsey wanted to account for differences in status, income, and age), the report used prisons on the debatable assumption that imprisonment was part of the lower-class cultural norm. Kinsey was also selective in the acts he chose to count, ignoring not just acts that did not lead to orgasm but also group sex, sadism, masochism, and transvestism as too marginal. As Sarah Igo has pointed out, the entire project had an ironic edge in that Kinsey envisioned his statistics as necessary to prevent an individual becoming "unique and unexplainable except through an elaborate investigation of him as an isolated entity," lay the groundwork for judgments of “average” as ”normal."[^13]

For many psychiatrists, psychologists and social scientists, however, the problem with the reports was not the revelations about homosexuality or extramarital sexuality but the naturalistic assumptions that concentrated on outlet to the detriment of meaning. All the information in the reports were unlikely to help Americans find themselves, psychiatrists charged, because they had nothing to say about internal states. By ignoring the complexity of consciousness, Kinsey reduced the self to mere biological reflexes and all choice to acting on impulse. By pruning the meaning of a sexual act to release of energy, Kinsey obfuscated the uniqueness of individual sexual lives. His description of sex made no mention of relationships, the institutional context in which sex took place. “Love,” which many critics took to be the culturally sanctioned goal of sex, was absent from the Kinsey investigations. The anthropologist Ashley Montagu complained that Kinsey’s report ignored emotions altogether. The literary critic and advocate of Freud Lionel Trilling argued that Kinsey equated the natural with the good. “Although,” Trilling wrote “the Report directs the harshest language toward the idea of the Normal, saying that it has stood in the way of any true scientific knowledge of sex, it is itself by no means averse to letting the idea of the Natural develop quietly into the idea of the Normal.” That surreptitious assumption, Trilling continued, was why the Kinsey Report “has an extravagant fear of all ideas that do not seem to it to be, as it were, immediately dictated by simple physical fact.”[^14] Margaret Mead charged that the report shared the faults of the culture it purported to measure, an emphasis on size, numbers, money, publicity, and sales.[^15]

Despite their vocal opposition to Kinsey’s naturalism, many of his critics in fact had become more receptive to anchoring the self in biological foundations. Both Mead and Montagu tempered the cultural relativism of their prewar and war work. Their primary concern in their writings of the late 1940s and 1950s which circulated in such popular venues as *Saturday Review* and *Redbook* emphasized the constraints that the type of body one had placed on the workings of culture and the freedoms of the individual to create her self. The standards that both used to judge cultural life were less those of their prior cultural relativism in which what mattered was how a culture fit a people's circumstances than how well cultures conformed to certain givens. Their culturalism did not disappear but observers could note how muted in had become. Nowhere was this more apparent in discussions of gendering.

Born Israel Ehrenberg in London in 1905, Montagu had begun his career by challenging the coherence of the concept of race in *Man’s Most Dangerous Myth: The Fallacy of Race* (1942). Race was not, he argued, rooted in distinctive biological differences since variation within racial groups was as great as among them. Nor did physical markers dictate mental or moral differences. In his draft of the UNESCO statement on race in 1950, Montagu drew on the vitalist biology of the anarchist Petr Kropotkin to insist on a common human nature formed by a biological drive for cooperation. His denial of mental and temperamental differences provoked scholarly criticism for his tendency to overgeneralize from limited evidence. It also led to attacks for alleged Communism, which cost him a position at Rutgers. Carving out a niche for himself as a public expert, he turned his attention to sex differences with *The Natural Superiority of Women* (1953).

Women, Montagu asserted, were naturally healthier and more intelligent than men, which were qualities that followed from their inclination for cooperation. Most importantly women benefitted psychologically from their physical closeness to children. Montagu’s argument posited an ironclad linkage between biological attributes and social role, which in turn created the valuable components of culture. Montagu envisioned women as the agents of cooperation, altruism and love. “*It is the function of women to teach men how to be human*,” he declared. Women’s biological makeup better suited them for bolstering human relations than for engaging in competitive or solitary pursuits. Given his cooperative ethos, Montagu emphasized female nurturing to give anthropological imprimatur to the gender divisions of American democracy. “It is not for nothing,” he continued in defense of a division of functions, “that the Bolsheviks attempted to abolished the family and masculinize women, while the Nazis made informers of children against their parents, and put the State so much before the family that it became a behemoth that well-nigh destroyed everyone who was victimized by it.”[@montagu1953, p. 143, 147 Emphasis in the original.]

Montagu saw little variation among cultures; race, class, nation, or region did not significantly alter the primacy of biological endowment, a reversal of his earlier work. Although sometimes regarded as a precursor of modern feminism because of his praise of female intelligence, creativity and fellow feeling, Montagu was not so much advocating a redistribution of power or role change as securing the foundational qualities of the female self. It was, the feminist Eve Merriam wrote, a left-handed compliment from someone whose pre-eminent position enabled such generosity.[@merriam1964, p. 187]

Mead might have made an even sharper biological turn. In 1958, Mead’s interest in biology as a factor in personality development had progressed to the point that she hired Barbara Heath, Sheldon’s former assistant, to do somatotypes in Papua New Guinea. By the early 1960s, she had found some affinity with Konrad Lorenz, the Austrian ethologist whose work on imprinting and on aggression articulated perhaps the most prominent version of biological influence on formation of the self. Her postwar consideration of the biological determinants of self began with her *Male and Female* (1949). Mead argued that biological divide between male and female was not limited to the obvious differences in sexual organs and role in reproduction. She discerned contrasts in energy, attention, perception, and initiative. She also insisted that the female self, whatever else it accomplished, was inextricably engaged with the emotional development of children since its body was the generator of mother love.

That anatomical differences generated different selves represented a change in emphasis from Mead’s earlier work. *Coming of Age in Samoa* (1928) and *Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies* (1935) stressed human flexibility and plasticity in sexual orientations, character traits, and role; *Male and Female* emphasized the universality of division and the limits on plasticity. Mead not only emphasized the split between the sexes in child birth and rearing but further contended that biological differences were at the base of all cultures. All cultures, she insisted, parceled out typical cultural traits along sexual lines. Crucially, however, cultures did not separate male and female in the same ways. There were, Mead argued, no personality traits that were exclusively male or female. Different cultures regarded beauty, intelligence, kindness, or friendliness in different ways. Bravery was not solely a male trait; cooperation did not belong solely to females. In the end, Mead iterated that insistence on rigid gender roles was the basis of much “inequality and waste in the world.”[^18]

Squaring her recognition of biological difference and her hope for a more flexible expectations of women's personalities took some doing. As with her earlier work, *Male and Female* was both field research report and cultural criticism of the United States. She continued to criticize prudery about somatic functions (including sexual desire) and its inversion, the excessive eroticization of bodies. Both prudery and eroticization inhibited the ability of Americans to feel at home in their own bodies(141). Mead was especially critical of the withdrawal of fathers from parenting responsibilities. Ironically it was American mothers who reminded boys to act like men. It was a crucial instance of Mead's fundamental complaint that the "problem" was women, rather than relations between men and women. "As surely as we believe that the present troublesome problems of sex adjustment are due to the position of women alone we commit ourselves to a long series of false moves as we attempt to push women out of the home, into the home, out of the home, adding mounting confusion of the difficulties born of a changing world . . . ”[@mead1949, 299-301] Among moves that Mead considered false were not simply restriction of female intelligence and male sensitivity as abnormal but a social refusal to let gender differences play out.

Although Mead's talk of female docility and endorsement of mother love as essential raised Betty Friedan's ire in *Feminine Mystique*, its position within the larger critique of *Male and Female* made it different from the widely circulated anti-feminist tract *Modern Woman: The Lost Sex* (1947) by Ferdinand Lundberg and Marynia Farnham. Lundberg and Farnham's screed excoriated American women for their unnatural abandonment of motherhood and domestic life -- two roles for which they were suited. Influenced by the feminist movement and war-time employment, American women no longer found satisfaction in child-bearing. As mothers, they tended to be rejecting, overprotective, domineering, or over-affectionate. Any of the four types were responsible neurotic and unhappy children, which Lundberg and Farnham estimated constituted one fourth to one third of the population.[^19]

Lundberg and Farnham frequently claimed the mantle of Freud, but both psychoanalysts and Neo-Freudians found their work simplistic.[@zaretsky2000, p. 338-41] At issue in postwar debates over the uses of Freud was the nature of the energy provided by drives or impulses and how modifiable they were by social institutions. Freud’s understanding of the formation of the self had matured over the course of his career, but a fairly constant portion was libido theory. In it, Freud held that _trieb_ (alternatively translated as “drives” or “instinct”) were fundamentally sexual in nature. The energy focuses on different zones at different moments in an individual’s childhood. Should it become fixated on certain parts, psychopathology would arise. Drives are relentless and fundamentally antisocial, leading to efforts to regulate them. This regulation could be conscious (suppression), unconscious (repression through internalization of social prohibitions and norms), or channeled (sublimation). Freud envisioned the individual as continually at odds with him or herself, yet capable of some forms of psychic health by using the energy of the drives for work and love.[^20]

Although revisionists accepted Freud’s notion of a depth psychology in which unconscious motivation--retrievable through dreams, fantasies, and slips--accounted for external behavior, they rejected the libido theory. Such analysts as Erik Erikson, Karen Horney, Harry Stack Sullivan, and Erich Fromm challenged the exclusive concentration on the erotic, Freud’s hydraulic conception of energy that limited the amount available to an individual, and the orthodox assertion of the universality of Oedipal conflict. Revisionists charged that empirical evidence was lacking for all these propositions. Others criticized Freud’s version of female sexuality in which the child transfers desire from mother to father and yearns for a penis as incoherent. At bottom, they objected to a view of biological endowment as unalterable and proposed instead a view in which the self under the impress of nature and society was more variable, dynamic, and contingent.[^21]

With its emphasis on social context rather than biologically-based drives, revisionism opened the possibility of connecting psychological development to political change. Most notable in this regard was Erich Fromm, who discerned commonalities between Freud and Marx. “Different as they were, they have in common an uncompromising will to liberate man, an equally uncompromising faith in truth as the instrument of liberation and the belief that the condition for this liberation lies in man's capacity to break the chain of illusion.”[^22] In Fromm’s synthesis, dynamic psychology provided the mechanism by which social existence gave rise to consciousness while historical materialism contributed an etiology to why certain character types predominated at different times in human history. Fromm believed libidinal theory was of limited value in explaining why a particular social class featured a particular character type. It was unlikely, he thought, that every petit bourgeois had anal fixations. If the human instinctual apparatus was not infinitely malleable, it nonetheless changed in response to the historical problems it faced. Fromm’s revisionism was most apparent in his view of the family as the conduit of historical context through the particular bodily and psychic gratification structure. As long as it bestowed the proper rewards, the family would give rise to the typical character type. Should families cease to deliver rewards, the stage was set for new character types and social change.[^23]

If Fromm jettisoned orthodoxy for radical ends, others hewed to it for similar reasons. Although the analytic establishment used Freud to secure patient adjustment to normal social life, thinkers diverse as Herbert Marcuse, Lionel Trilling, and the sociologist Dennis Wrong glimpsed in Freudian libido theory the possibility of true opposition to the political and social status quo. They held that the drives did _not_ set the self forever but opened possibilities for overturning social convention. Revisionists had treated nature as a form of determinism, but their work relied on what Wrong termed the oversocialized conception of man (sic). By positing social and cultural causation activated by an ingrained need for approval, revisionism turned out at bottom to be a theory of conformity in which rebels were incompletely socialized. Freud himself was dismissive of social revolution, but his conception of the self caught between drive and internalized social restriction was a portrait of a person in struggle. Aware that the manifestation of instincts was not fixed, defenders of the libido theory envisioned ways that redirected instincts could aid nonconformist ends. For the literary critic Trilling, the biological substratum remained beyond conformity to culture.[^24]

For the philosopher Marcuse, the unleashing of eros was an attack on capitalist society’s conversion of sex energy into alienated labor. “The irreconcilable conflict is not between work (reality principle) and Eros (pleasure principle), but between alienated labour (performance principle) and Eros,” Marcuse proclaimed.[^25] In their desire to separate themselves from what they regarded as the conformist tendencies of neo-Freudianism, both Marcuse and Trilling flirted with positions that made bodily pleasure the sole measure of meaningful selfhood, underplaying the contributions of Enlightenment reason. A fear that American culture might co-opt the supposedly liberated aspects of instinctual life later led Marcuse to advance the idea of repressive desublimation in _One-Dimensional Man_ (1964).

Although most debate revolved around how the body determined identity, there were instances where self and body became unconnected and revealed how plastic gender behavior could be. Some were played for fun, as in Billy Wilder’s film _Some Like It Hot_ (1959), in which Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis dress and live as women to escape gangsters. Others, such as the case of Christine Jorgensen went to the heart of body and identity. Although born with a penis, George William Jorgensen felt early on as a child that she was a woman trapped in a man’s body. Although psychoanalysts regarded such a condition as a mental illness, the result of improper identification with the properly sexed parent during early childhood, medical doctors regarded the condition as inadequate physical development of the proper sexual characteristics. Beginning hormone therapy with the husband of a classmate, Jorgensen traveled to Europe to have sex reassignment surgery which she completed in Denmark in 1951 and 1952. Jorgensen became an instant celebrity upon her return to the United States. Often an object of derisive humor, Jorgensen responded by adopting a glamorous and outgoing persona, quite different from her diffidence as a boy. Forbidden from marrying (her birth certificate indicated she was male), she nonetheless by her very existence demonstrated that gender was not a binary, incommensurate condition and that genitalia and chromosomes alone did not provide a completely solid foundation for identity.[^26]
