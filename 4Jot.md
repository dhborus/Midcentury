#  Chapter Four:

### The Decentered Search for the Centered Self
\
\
Just before he lights out for Europe, the narrator-protagonist of James Baldwin’s *Giovanni’s Room* (1956), David, muses that he did so because he “wanted to find myself.” He regards that desire as peculiarly American, noting that the phrase is neither current “in the language of any other people” and “certainly does not mean what it says but betrays a nagging suspicion that something has been misplaced.” The sojourn to the Old World does little to render David’s desires, inclinations, and capacities legible or stable. Unable to accept his homosexual longings, particularly for the titular character whom he abandons in the face of his conviction and execution for murder, David ends alienated from his very physical being, baffled when looking in the mirror by “what moves in this body” and for “what this body is searching.”[@baldwin1956a, p. 39, 189]

Contemporary critics found fault not only with the novel's unapologetic treatment of homosexuality but also its lack of coverage of black life and accused Baldwin of decadence and elitism. They missed, however, the central contention of Baldwin's fiction and nonfiction alike: the race problem originated in whites' inability to know themselves. Baldwin was only one of many artists and scholars who held that postwar American society made it difficult for Americans to develop a firm sense of who they were, allow consistent personal expression or reliably foster expanded capacities. As the leading exemplar of modernity, the United States was, the argument went, especially prone to psychic upheavals and fragmentation despite the often placid exterior of its citizens. Writing in 1962, the husband and wife team Mary and Eric Josephson laid blame for such psycho-social disorders as loss of self, anxiety states, despair, rootlessness, apathy, meaninglessness, and loss of beliefs and values on the absence of meaningful communities and interpersonal relations. Other commentators blamed corporate bureaucracy, advertising, and a wide array of institutional demands for conformity such as schools and the media. [@josephson1962. Popular contemporary criticisms of American life include John Keats, *The Crack in the Picture Window* (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1957); @packard1957; and @whyte1956. Two by Daniel Horowitz examine the genre: *Vance Packard & American Social Criticism* (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 1994) and *The Anxieties of Affluence: Critiques of American Consumer Culture, 1939-1979* (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 2004).]

Postwar concern about the insubstantiality of selves quickly assumed a political cast. Material and objective causes did not, most analysts contended, fully explanation popular support for Fascist and Communist regimes.  Mass intolerance and antidemocratic movements were best explained by psychosocial abnormalities. Erich Fromm's *Escape from Freedom* (1941), Theodor Adorno's *Authoritarian Personality* (1950), and Hannah Arendt's *Origin of Totalitarianism* all attributed totalitarian success to the ability of ruling groups to manipulate unfulfilled psychological needs. Although fascist and communist ideologies had little appeal to most Americans, many commentators nonetheless worried that a society of anomic individuals who lacked internalized standards were fodder for poseurs and demagogues. That possibility no doubt fanned an interest in Tocqueville's argument that democracy produced citizens who sought safety i a culture of stifling uniformity and who were capable of massing against those who were distinctive or different.[@mcclay1994 contains a useful summary of the tendency to explain political phenomena by psycho-social factors. It is noteworthy perhaps that all three were Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany. The philosopher Jacob Talmon, author of *The Origins of Totalitarian Democracy* (Boston: Beacon Press, 1952) might also be included in this group.] Augmenting the theoretical work of the social critics was that of social psychologists in a series of experiments Solomon Asch and Stanley Milgram obtained results that suggested most individuals lacked the psychological assuredness to resist a relentless majority or a demanding, unfeeling authority. Asch (1951, 1956) observed that subjects more often than not acceded to the group truth, even when it countered their own perceptions. For his part, Milgram discovered that most people would continue to punish others when ordered to do so. There was, many observers concluded a "Good German" in all of us.[The pertinent studies are @asch1951; @asch1956; and @milgram1963.

Care of the self was a concern of long standing, but for much of American history it had been framed in religious terms. Americans worried about their souls.  Religious
