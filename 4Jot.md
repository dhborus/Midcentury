#  Chapter Four:

### The Decentered Search for the Centered Self

Just before he takes off for Europe, the narrator-protagonist of James Baldwin’s *Giovanni’s Room* (1956), David, muses that he did so because he “wanted to find myself.” He regards that desire as peculiarly American, noting that the phrase is neither current “in the language of any other people” and “certainly does not mean what it says but betrays a nagging suspicion that something has been misplaced.” The sojourn to the Old World does little to render David’s desires, inclinations, and capacities legible or stable.

Other commentators blamed corporate bureaucracy, advertising, and a wide array of institutional demands for conformity such as schools and the media.[@josephson1962. Popular contemporary criticisms of American life include John Keats, *The Crack in the Picture Window* (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1957); @packard1957; and @whyte1956. Two by Daniel Horowitz examine the genre: *Vance Packard & American Social Criticism* (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 1994) and *The Anxieties of Affluence: Critiques of American Consumer Culture, 1939-1979* (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 2004).]
