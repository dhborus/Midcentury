#  Chapter Four:

### The De-centered Search for the Centered Self
\
\
Just before he lights out for Europe, the narrator-protagonist of James Baldwin’s *Giovanni’s Room* (1956), David, muses that he did so because he “wanted to find myself.” He regards that desire as peculiarly American, noting that the phrase is neither current “in the language of any other people” and “certainly does not mean what it says but betrays a nagging suspicion that something has been misplaced.” The sojourn to the Old World does little to render David’s desires, inclinations, and capacities legible or stable. Unable to accept his homosexual longings, particularly for the titular character whom he abandons in the face of his conviction and execution for murder, David ends alienated from his very physical being, baffled when looking in the mirror by “what moves in this body” and for “what this body is searching.”[@baldwin1956, p. 39, 189]

Contemporary critics found fault not only with the novel's unapologetic treatment of homosexuality but also its lack of coverage of black life and accused Baldwin of decadence and elitism. They missed, however, the central contention of Baldwin's fiction and nonfiction alike: the race problem originated in whites' inability to know themselves. Baldwin was only one of many artists and scholars who held that postwar American society made it difficult for Americans to develop a firm sense of who they were, allow consistent personal expression or reliably foster expanded capacities. As the leading exemplar of modernity, the United States was, the argument went, especially prone to psychic upheavals and fragmentation despite the often placid exterior of its citizens. Writing in 1962, the husband and wife team Mary and Eric Josephson laid blame for such psycho-social disorders as loss of self, anxiety states, despair, rootlessness, apathy, meaninglessness, and loss of beliefs and values on the absence of meaningful communities and interpersonal relations. Other commentators blamed corporate bureaucracy, advertising, and a wide array of institutional demands for conformity such as schools and the media. [@josephson1962. Popular contemporary criticisms of American life include John Keats, *The Crack in the Picture Window* (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1957); @whyte1956; and  @packard1957. Two by Daniel Horowitz examine the genre: *Vance Packard & American Social Criticism* (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 1994) and *The Anxieties of Affluence: Critiques of American Consumer Culture, 1939-1979* (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 2004).]

Postwar concern about the insubstantiality of selves quickly assumed a political cast. Material and objective causes did not, most analysts contended, fully explanation popular support for Fascist and Communist regimes.  Mass intolerance and antidemocratic movements were best explained by psychosocial abnormalities. Erich Fromm's *Escape from Freedom* (1941), Theodor Adorno's *Authoritarian Personality* (1950), and Hannah Arendt's *Origin of Totalitarianism* all attributed totalitarian success to the ability of ruling groups to manipulate unfulfilled psychological needs. Although fascist and communist ideologies had little appeal to most Americans, many commentators nonetheless worried that a society of anomic individuals who lacked internalized standards were fodder for poseurs and demagogues. That possibility no doubt fanned an interest in Tocqueville's argument that democracy produced citizens who sought safety i a culture of stifling uniformity and who were capable of massing against those who were distinctive or different.[@mcclay1994 contains a useful summary of the tendency to explain political phenomena by psycho-social factors. It is noteworthy perhaps that all three and the philosopher Jacob Talmon, author of *The Origins of Totalitarian Democracy* (Boston: Beacon Press, 1952), were Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany.] Augmenting the theoretical work of the social critics was that of social psychologists in a series of experiments Solomon Asch and Stanley Milgram obtained results that suggested most individuals lacked the psychological assuredness to resist a relentless majority or a demanding, unfeeling authority. Asch (1951, 1956) observed that subjects more often than not acceded to the group truth, even when it countered their own perceptions. For his part, Milgram discovered that most people would continue to punish others when ordered to do so. There was, many observers concluded a "Good German" in all of us.[The pertinent studies are @asch1951; @asch1956; and @milgram1963. For a discussion of the implications for the social psychology of postwar politics, see *Critical Psychology: An Introduction*, Dennis Fox and Isaac Prilleltensky, editors (London: Sage, 1997) and Israel Charny, *Fascism and Democracy in the Human Mind: A Bridge between Mind and Society* (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2006)]

In meeting the growing weight of expectations placed on the self, Americans increasingly looked to psychological discourse or therapy rather than religion or philosophy, as would have been the case in the past. Where once Americans examined the state of their souls, their postwar counterparts more often than not turned their attention to their mental and emotional makeup. Emblematic of the shift was Rabbi Joshua Liebman's best-selling *Peace of Mind* (1947), which blended Talmudic wisdom with Freudian insight and a new popular advice literature, spearheaded by Ann Landers and Abigail Van Buren, that substituted psychological discernment for the old conduct of life bromides.[^5] Five times as many doctorates in psychology were awarded in the 1950s as the decade before. The number of psychiatrists increased ten fold from 1939 to 1959.[@scull2010]  Those numbers do not include the tremendous growth in psychological-based pastoral counseling. With numbers came a new prestige. Robert Linder’s *Fifty-Minute Hour* (1955) was indicative of the midcentury tendency to extol the psychiatrist as seer and depth psychology as the royal road to understanding motivation -- a tendency that informed a spate of movies ranging from Alfred Hitchcock's *Spellbound* (1945) to John Houston's *Freud* (1962). Small wonder, then, that *Life* Magazine hailed the 1950s as the "Age of Psychology."[^7]

Efforts in the "Age of Psychology" to find the foundations of a secure and stable self proceeded along a number of dimensions. Although Freud and Freudian discourse and therapies garnered great attention, they by no means had a monopoly. Personality testing, which gained great popularity in business and schools with its promise of matching people with jobs and mates with which they were best suited, owed much to Carl Jung's *Psychological Types* (1923).[The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator was the leading tool for categorizing and sorting people during the mid-twentieth century. @emre2018] For all the emphasis on thought, feeling, and inclination, biological determinism remained a crucial component of the search for a centered self. A number of investigators pinned their hopes on deciphering the somatic basis of selfhood. Others pondered the proper relationship between the self and others. At stake was whether society was too pressing on individuals or whether social bonds were too insubstantial and evanescent. The two concerns merged in one of the key worries of postwar American life, the nature of teenagers. A period of changing bodies and role testing, the teenage years proved fertile ground for theorists and artists alike.

**Body and Self**
\
\
Although the proliferating psychological currents differed widely over whether the self was inborn and inherent or more undeveloped and open to construction and reconstruction, most held that the self was an ethereal rather than material entity. Selfhood was primarily understood as a matter of conceptions, ideas, and spirit, the awareness of one's unique qualities and capacities. Even those aspects of the self that were clearly generated by the needs of the body -- food, sleep, sex -- were, because they were universal, treated more as stimuli that the self processed and shaped rather than a determinant of selfhood. Nonetheless, biological determinism hardly vanished from American cultural and intellectual life. Not only did explanations for the self rooted in the type of body one possessed enable commentators to locate a center in human nature, talk of a biological foundation, as Nadine Weidman has observed, had the advantage of providing a challenge to Soviet claims to be building the new human.[@weidman2012]

No one was as insistent that the self was a function of body as psychologist William Sheldon (1898-1977). The godson of William James, Sheldon drew upon post-Mendelian modern genetics with its emphasis on multiple determinants of traits to lay out an elaborate form of somatic classification. His scheme rated physiques along scales that ran from one to seven based of their sphericality, muscularity and linearity, which allowed Sheldon to assign each body a three-digit number. Sheldon maintained that somatotypes did not change over time, even with weight change. He took a similar approach with personality, ranking on the basis of sixty traits that he claimed originated in bodily need and which fell into clusters around relaxation, muscular activity involving action and power, and restraint and inhibition. People with prominent guts (endomorphs) craved relaxation and pampering---both somatic and psychological. Muscle-bound men were driven toward action and power and took little note of others, and so on. Although Sheldon conceded both that traits could appear in different forms and that there were numerous cases in which morphologies did not match with manifest temperaments, he never doubted physique was destiny. Not surprisingly, somatotypers were prone to snap judgments. Physical anthropologist Carl Seltzer breezily contended that weak (effeminate by his lights) body types (about 15% of the white, male population) were likely to lack psychic energy, proper motivation, sociability, and appropriate values. Sheldon applauded the 1-7-2 body (which had the highest muscularity and little sphericality or linearity) as the “incarnation of a heroic ideal,” the “masculine ideal of warlike and conquesting people,” the “American eagle of somatotypes” and claimed that the type was most often found in those who traced their heritage to Anglo-Saxon countries. His animal analogies for other categories were less complimentary.[^10]

Sheldon’s overt racism, support for eugenics, and ornery personality initially proved no obstacle to widespread acceptance of his “science.” Tapping the desire for grounded and knowable self, Sheldon's contention that the self was a consequence of its bodily form lay people and professionals alike a way to comprehend and classify the seeming diversity of human behavior and inclinations. Magazines ran such articles as “What Manner of Morph Are You?” and “How Your Shape Shapes Your Life.” Psychologists subjected numerous Ivy League freshmen to nude photographing sessions and psychological probing when arriving on campus. By the mid-1950s, however, Sheldonism was under critical scrutiny. Detractors charged he mixed causation with correlation, ignored changes in body type, offered “just so” stories as explanations, and had failed to produce convincing results despite years of measuring. His research assistant simply confirmed what critics suspected when she claimed he fudged his classifications so that body and personality type meshed.[^11]

Alfred Kinsey’s approach to the body-self relation has proven more politically and intellectually credible than Sheldon’s. A biologist who claimed to have no vested interest in the outcome, he undertook his famous reports on human sexual behavior as “first of all a report on what people do, which raises no question of what they should do.” Kinsey and his associates obtained data that previous investigators had not on such seemingly taboo acts as masturbation, homosexual contact, and non-marital intercourse through innovative interview techniques. The results were surprising to many. Acts thought rare and often morally out of bounds turned out to be fairly common. Taken together, the non-heterosexual, non-marital acts outnumbered marital ones. Given individuals in a variety of different acts, Kinsey classified people not dichotomously but along a spectrum. One was not gay or straight but engaged in primarily one or both acts. Taking a decidedly amoral and biological position, Kinsey dismissed the views of those who regarded some acts immoral, criticizing those who did not “want to believe that there are gradations in these matters from one to the other extreme.”[^12] For Kinsey, all acts were undertaken for sexual release ("outlest" in his terminology) and were biologically commensurate.

The traditional argument holds that psychology and the therapeutic undercut religious strictures about holy and sanctified behavior by elevating psychic peace and adjustment. See [@rieff1966] and [@meyer1965]. [@stevens2010] has challenged the interpretation, ontending that the turn to psychology was a complex and serious achievement of Protestant modernism, not reducible to simplistic pop psychological extrapolations.
