Erikson endorsed Freud's observation that a healthy self was capable of work and love but he concentrated more on the former than the latter. Others claimed that adolescents were far too obsessed with the latter. Or at least sex, a result many claimed flowed from the now familiar charge that parental supervision was too lax. That was the position of Marynia Farnham, whose *Adolescent* (1951) iterated her complaints against American mothers that she staked out in *Modern Woman*. Although she acknowledged American teenagers were caught between physical maturity and social prohibition, Farnham's response was not to recommend the loosening of moral strictures (or, find avenues for sublimation) but to espouse stricter supervision. Not surprisingly, Farnham was convinced that the job of supervision was that of the American wife. She excoriated women who "deserted the home for the supposedly more rewarding and exiting life of rivalry with men" and criticized parents who failed to enforce guidelines in the mistaken belief that “youngsters can make all decisions for themselves and that uncurbed freedom is their right from birth on.”[@farnham1951, p. 211, 221]

Based on his observation of ten Chicago-area high schools, sociologist James Coleman worried if re-establishing control was even possible. In his 1961 view, American teenagers had created a counterculture. Walled off from the rest of society, teenagers so resembled one other that being a teenager outweighed differences in race, income, or geography. The culture that teenagers built was, Coleman insisted, revolved around trivial concerns and driven by peer pressure and minute attention to the judgment of others. These other-directed personalities in training were consumers par excellence, interested only in making the proper impression at sporting events and dances. Much to Coleman’s dismay, they cared little for academic success and relegated scholars to social marginality. Teen culture, Coleman concluded, even when not openly delinquent, was incompatible with preparation for adulthood or contribution to the community.[@coleman1961]

As sociologist Bennett Berger argued in an incisive 1963 review, much of the criticism of teenagers exaggerated their separate and "countercultural" way of life. Coleman, for instance, missed a number of similarities between the teenagers that he studied and their parents. A majority of parents probably did not look at high school as solely, or even primarily, an academic venture. Teenagers' interest in cars, clothes, the opposite sex, and sports followed adults’ interest in those very same things. Berger pointed out that football, which Coleman dismissed as anti-intellectual and retrograde, served as a catalyst for community building, something academic achievement were too individualized and specialized to accomplish. Tales of juvenile delinquency and rock 'n' roll fueled rebellion notwithstanding, American teenagers could imitate their parents' way of life. A majority of Coleman's respondents indicated that they preferred the parent-approved Pat Boone over Elvis Presley by a wide margin and claimed that they would rather risk breaking with a friend than earning their parents’ disapproval.[^55]

It was such conformity that led to the proliferation in the early 1960s of cultural critics who used Erikson to advocate a re-imagination of American adolescence. In the work of cultural anthropolist Jules Henry, anarchist critic and Gestalt psychotherapist Paul Goodman, and doctorate in education Edgar Z. Friendenberg, studies of the American teenager rooted in sympathy for their dilemmas became a criticism of American way of selfhood.
