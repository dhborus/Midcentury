By the end of the period, Erikson’s work had become an inspiration for criticism not simply of the state of adolescence but also of the culture to which adolescences were expected to adapt. The critics whose indictments appeared in the last 1950s and early 1960s wrote with considerably more sympathy for the dilemmas of teenagers than Farnham or Coleman and were less committed to a version of the self anchored in prevailing values. Taken as a whole, the professor of education Edgar Z. Friedenberg, the anarchist-Gestalt therapist Paul Goodman, and the cultural anthropologist Jules Henry criticized American adolescence for its failure both to be a true moratorium and to provide viable pathways to meaningful love and work. What bedeviled American teenagers was not so much that they were turned loose on their own but that they made decisions in a social environment with an impoverished sense of the possibility of self.[@friedenberg1959 @goodman2012; @henry1963].

Of the three, Friendenberg drew most directly on Erikson. He deplored that American adolescence had ceased to be a period of experimentation and true counterculture and had instead been contaminated by adult insistence that activities have socially acceptable ends. Unlike simple societies and lower-class subcultures, Friendenberg argued, intricate social organizations require an extended testing process so people develop a repertoire of responses to complex and changing expectations. Stable ego identities emerge, he maintained, when individuals set themselves against the social order and become aware of “the complex, subtle, and precious difference between himself and his environment.”[@friedenberg1959, p. 13] Controversially, Friedenberg advocated freedom for teenagers to act as if they were young aristocrats. He meant by the contention that adolescents would develop a profound sense of self if it were safe for them to be self-assured, not that they should learn to act imperiously and without consequences. Adults, he conceded, were unlikely to accept such a demeanor from their offspring but there was a model for safe aristocratic demeanor in British boarding schools, which gave “adolescents something to be adolescent about” in a relatively protected environment. American children, on the other hand, were provided experiences with the appearance of adulthood but none of the difficulties or unpleasantness. Friendenberg criticized teachers, parents and those in the helping professions for failing to let disagreements to unfold properly. The bland other-directedness of modern American society was predicated on the belief that all disagreements were unproductive. Because teenage differences were actively suppressed, American teenagers had fewer chances to achieve authentic self understanding.

The consequence was a stage of life that made American adolescents ill prepared to work and love productively as adults. In contrast to Coleman's portrait of teenagers without supervision, both Goodman and Henry recognized adult control in American high schools, apprentice programs, and even much recreation. They glimpsed in these activities training for the regimented work of adulthood, what Goodman called "the organized system," [The introduction to @goodman2012 outlines goodman's view of the American political and social system.] Goodman maintained that the organized system did not want youth to grow into men because men "did not suit." They were too likely to question and to demand meaning, something that ran counter to the rote and discipline necessary for most extant jobs for which teenagers were preparing. Unlike Friedenberg, Goodman envisioned the problem of youth as a divorce from society and life itself. Adolescence in general and the school in particularly created boundaries and limited impulses. Students therefore were denied their chance to mold their world to their liking. Lessons learned in high school continued to offices (and bedrooms). The

If Farnham and Coleman looked rather unsympathetiSchools, he charged, were factories of impulse suppression and sexual prudery. Given his Gestalt commitments, Goodman was especially opposed to selves divided from society. Youth institutions enforced boundaries, denying the young the chance to mold the world to their liking. Under such circumstances, Goodman argued, adulthood was mere adjustment and perpetual living with a perpetually constrained ego. Simply rejecting the American way of growing up was insufficient, Goodman maintained. The Beats earned his disapproval for their resignation and, while understanding of delinquents’ response, he nonetheless found them too fatalistic for his liking. Growing up with meaning, Goodman concluded, required reworking the world of love and work to encourage honesty, independence, and caring.


Goodman and Friedenberg shared a dislike of other-directedness and consumerism for preventing independence and authenticity. Although praised for their emphasis on teenage initiative, both attracted criticism their partial portraits of the teenage condition. Critics charged they did far too little empirical observation, dwelt far too much on the pathologies of adolescence and all too often attributed them solely to adult actions. Then, as now, they were also criticized for making the male teenager the norm, a choice possibly a consequence of their own homosexuality. Women, Goodman insisted in the introduction, did not grow up absurd since they “will have children which is absolutely self-justifying, like any other natural or creative act.” Further, he went on in the introduction, the problems of teenage boys were “intensely interesting to women, for if the boys do not grow up to be men, where shall the women find men?”[^48]

Anthropologist Jules Henry, on the other hand, took girls’ problems seriously and provided a more detailed description of the problems of finding one’s self. The adolescence sections of his _Culture Against Man_ (1963), based on observations of St. Louis-area high schools, revealed how the essence of the teen years was insecurity. More than any other analyst, Henry captured the silent terror and constant confusion of adolescence. Writing with a socially aware Freudianism, Henry was sympathetic to the costs of the demands of the id, which were exaggerated by the constant mobility of American life. Because families moved so frequently, friendships, which would have enabled sublimation, were often unstable. Such instability resulted in an inadequacy felt on the prom dance floor and automobile backseats. Parental shortcomings lay less in the absence of discipline than in failure to establish and live out meaningful lives. This inability of adults to provide ego ideals, Henry argued, created a void that peers filled. Girls were especially affected in adolescence. The difficulty lay not so much in limited goals, since beauty, fashion and popularity struck him as legitimate and meaningful pursuits, as parental goading of girls into sexual competition to snare the right husband and condemnation of those who refused to compete.[^49]

Henry located another consequence of the lack of ego ideals in the aversion of teenagers to work. The example of “hard-working daddies” who are “little at home and burdened with the irritations, coronaries, and ulcers of their work” only underwrote pleasure-seeking behavior. Schools, too, were inadequate in setting meaningful ideals. In contrast to Coleman, Henry regarded school work as unchallenging and meaningless. Studying, especially when nagged to do so by parents, made Henry’s informants feel at the will of others. Promise of vague future benefits from school work only compounded the feeling. Yet because adolescents neither developed their own standards of success nor were involved in institutions in which the standards were meaningful to their talents or aspirations, grades loomed large in their education and work life. Grading met no needs, Henry claimed, but it did accustom students to accept impersonal, standardized norms as the best metric of self-worth. For the majority, this too was a recipe for feelings of inadequacy. Turning to pleasure seeking in response yielded little long-term gain and augured poorly for leaving adolescence with an Eriksonian “reward.”
