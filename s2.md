The allure of permanent adolescence was part of the long-standing appeal of J. D. Salinger's *Cathcer in the Rye* (1951). The protagonist Holden Caulfield's tendency to make snap and absolute moral judgments, his emotional instability, and inability to form meaningful connections exemplify the traits that made teenagers fascinating and exasperating. Throughout the novel, Holden is prone to maudlin display of concern, tremendous remorse, and exaggerations and lies. Stung by the death of his brother Allie's death, Holden is deeply uncomfortable with himself and finds it hard to settle into a self. Adulthood by its very nature disturbs and repels him. Almost everyone who has read the book regardless of whether he or she admires Holden's truth telling or recoils from his whininess remembers his tendency to label adults as "phonies" in large measure for their acting in accord with social expectation rather than authentic personal inclination or exercising bad taste. For Holden, both reveal the existence of a world of artifice and manipulation. Yet Holden's adolescence runs deeper than rejection of the social conformity of the adult world.  He treats sexuality as an unwarranted aggression on the innocence of childhood and imagines himself as the protector of purity of children, the catcher in the rye who catches playing children from falling off the edge of a cliff. His uneasiness with adult maturity is further evident in his dismissal of his former teacher's advice that an immature man wishes to die of a noble cause while a mature one hopes to live humbly for one. In light of his fear of change as the destruction childish innocence (the obscenities on thee merry-go-round), it makes sense that Holden envies the stasis of the Eskimos in the diorama at the Natural History museum.

Some critics have touted Sylvia Plath’s novel *The Bell Jar* (1963) as the female version of *Catcher*, and the similarities are clear. Plath’s protagonist, Esther Greenwood, shares with Holden Caulfield a profound alienation from the adult world and from herself. Like him, she judges others as inauthentic and has no sense of what she wants to be. Yet the social world that Esther finds so oppressive is only partially the one that Holden believes is filled with phonies. The inauthenticity that Plath details takes on a special complexion because it is women’s roles that Esther finds so oppressive. Winner of a prestigious summer internship at a New York woman’s magazine, *Ladies Day*, Esther is unmoved by what other girls would have regarded as a dream chance, feeling only “still and empty”(2). Unlike her fellow interns, she rejects traditional goals. When asked what she wants to be, she can only manage that she doesn’t know. Female identity as conventionally advanced repels her. She compares marriage and children rearing to being “brainwashed”: “you went about numb as a slave in some private totalitarian state” (81). Childbirth is akin to being trapped in a “long, blind, doorless and windowless corridor of pain” (p. 62). The double standard infuriates her. She labels her boyfriend Buddy a “hypocrite” when he admits he is not a virgin and breaks off their engagement. Losing her virginity to a tall but not very good-looking mathematician in Cambridge leads to hemorrhaging and a trip to the hospital. In short, she regards the female existence as being under a bell jar --- an image she uses to describe her own empty, airless, suspended experience but applies later to the college girls who play bridge, gossip and study. Her ability to see the bell jar that others do not establishes her distinctive perception while pointing to a common condition for women.

Esther’s lack of traditional feminine desires prompts her to undertake an unsuccessful search for meaning. Her quest to be a writer comes to naught when she is rejected for a summer class at Harvard taught by a famous writer. Finding nothing satisfying, she veers toward a madness that liberates her from the social imperatives imposed upon middle-class women, but which also risks obliterating the internal self altogether. Where Holden aspires to be isolated or in a perpetual adolescent state, Esther struggles simply to be able to say “I am.” At times she feels a zombie inside her, preventing her from speaking or writing, convinced that her deteriorating penmanship is the sign of insanity she needs to hide from her doctor. Her suicide attempts fail because she is convinced that her body will not obey her mind. Where traditionally the mind (or head) has been regarded as the scene of the self, Esther experiences what Abigail Cheever has called “a profound disintegration” in which her body and her mind are not working in tandem; her rationality gone, her existence is affirmed by the acts of her body. Contending that it has “little tricks,” she sets as her goal escaping being “trapped in its stupid cage for fifty years” left “without any sense at all” (153).

As her disintegration worsens, Esther enters treatment with an arrogant, self-absorbed and unfeeling male psychiatrist who subjects her to electroshock therapy. Walking out, rather than endure more hellish torture, she continues her efforts at suicide. Eventually she comes close enough to succeeding by taking fifty sleeping pills at once and hiding in her cellar, which results in her confinement in a private hospital. There, after a successful electroshock treatment and an empathetic therapy with a female doctor, she finally comes to a tenuous and fragile grip on normality, being able to say at a funeral of a friend who successfully committed suicide, “I am, I am, I am,” which she ascribes to “the old brag of my heart.” Where her mother insists she treat her illness as if it were a bad dream, she counters to herself that she cannot since it was part of her. By retaining a sense of her madness, Esther emphasizes her distance from social roles, even as she prepares to be released into the social world and lead what others might term a normal existence. Yet the content of her character remains sketchy at best. Nor is it certain that she will not try suicide again. As such, Esther Greenwood serves as a stark example of how fragile the success of finding oneself had become.
