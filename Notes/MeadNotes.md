Girls vulnerable to restrictions of mind and body when boys have rights but boys vulnerable when spurred to efforts beyond strength. American culture tends to try to minimize differences but "with every adjustment that minimizes a difference, a vulnerability, in one sex, a differential strength in the other, diminishes their possibility of complementing each other, and corresponds -- symbolically -- to sealing off the constructive receptivity of the female and the vigorous outgoing constructive activity of muting them both in the end to a duller version of human life, in which each is denied the fullness of humanity that each might have had. . . . But as we guard, we may also keep the differences. Simply compensating for differences is in the end a form of denial." {Mead, 1949, #69289@371-2}

lost sex -- passing through a period of discrepancies in sex roles which are so conspicuous that efforts to disguise the price that both sexes pay are increasingly unsuccessful. And here is the separation from normal -- "Only if we perpetuate the habit of speaking about 'the position of women' in a vacuum will we fail to recognize that where one sex suffers, the other sex suffers also. As surely as we believe that the present troublesome problems of sex adjustment are due to the position of women alone we commit ourselves to a long series of false moves as we attempt to push women out of the home, into the home, out of the home, adding mounting confusion of the difficulties born of a changing world--climate of opinion, a shifting technology, and an increasing rate and violence of cultural change."{Mead, 1949, #69289@300-01}Â 

Flexibility possible but difficult. "It takes considerable effort on the part of both men and women to reorient ourselves to thinking -- when we think basically--that this is a world made not by men alone, in which women are unwilling and helpless dupes and fools or else powerful schemers hiding their power under their ruffled petticoats, but a world made by mankind for human beings of both sexes." {Mead, 1949, #69289@299-300}
