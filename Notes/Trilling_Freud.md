Freud found scientific ethos a basis for heroism. did not set out with the intention of becoming a humanist or of finding support for his scientific ideas in whatever authority humanism might have. {Trilling, 1955, #8674@15}

showed that poetry is indigenous to the very constitution of the mind; mind is (in the greater part of its tendency) a poetry-making faculty. Still lacks the feel of literature (so his comments on literature itself are not particularly important) {Trilling, 1955, #8674@16}

Literature dedicated to the conception of the self â€” can identify but can not realize it (woman who weeps at a play while her coachman shivers in the cold) {Trilling, 1955, #8674@17}

In almost every developed society, literature is able to conceive of the self, and the selfhood other others, far more intensely than the general culture ever can. {Trilling, 1955, #8674@19}

20 suspension of disbelief -- that applies to science as well as literature -- "constitutes moral faith -- the essence of the moral life would seem to consist in doing that most difficult thing in the world, making a willing suspension of disbelief in the selfhood of someone else." {Trilling, 1955, #8674@19-}

"Freud's acceptance of the phantasies of his early patients, his conclusion that their untruths had a meaning, a purpose, and even a value, was the suspension of disbelief in the selfhood of these patients." {Trilling, 1955, #8674@21}

"They (poets) accept the commission to represent something called reality that lies outside of literature, and, as it were, led to and served by pleasure. Sometimes, at the behest of reality, they question and even reprobate their hedonistic dreams." {Trilling, 1955, #8674@23}

Yeats bases the developed moral life on the autonomy of the youthful hedonistic pleasures.  For Keats pleasure principle is at the root of existence, knowledge, moral life. self can develop that it may perceive even very painful facts with a kind of pleasure (why we like tragedy) {Trilling, 1955, #8674@24}

- 9 Freud's worry that masculinity was under attack had been criticized (Trilling avers here) in the standoff of love versus power Freud favors the latter. Which Trilling links here to sexuality so that a man who once was said to have it on the brain and capable of thinking of nothing else was by midcentury seen as puritanical. {Trilling, 1955, #8674@27}

poet's sense of fame intensive expression of the sense of self, of the self defined by the thing it makes, which is conceived to be everlasting precisely because it was once a new thing, a thing added to the spirit of man. {Trilling, 1955, #8674@31}

Trilling cares about literature because he cares about the self -- literature is to give us that truth. And not culture primarily. "But for literature, as for Freud, the test of the culture is always the individual self, not the other way around. The function of literature . . . has been to makes us aware of the particularity of the selves, and the high authority of the self in its quarrel with its society and its culture. Literature is in that sense subversive." {Trilling, 1955, #8674@32-33}

cultures can proceed without an "accurate awareness of what a self is or what it may be. Trilling here calls it a loss of accurate knowledge and characterizes the United States as being in such a condition. A lack of the right relation of self to culture. {Trilling, 1955, #8674@33}

culture as selfhood for society -- way of thinking about life in society -- has organic unity autonomous character expressed by a style -- individual therefore implicated in society. Thinks about relation to social totality. {Trilling, 1955, #8674@34}

Freud as the popularizer of culture concept -- as bathing us in it. {Trilling, 1955, #8674@36}

To make a coherent life, to confront the terrors of the inner and the outer world, to establish the ritual and art, the pieties and duties which make possible the life of the group and the individual. [a nice little how moving it is and student must be sympathetic must think it is as it should be] {Trilling, 1955, #8674@37}

Trilling sees a good deal of assumption that individual should be at one with a culture -- culture therefore like a folk community -- bringing unity and coherence of members. {Trilling, 1955, #8674@38}

modern self intense and adverse imagination of its culture. Freud sees self formed and struggling against its culture. On one hand ego for id. On other needed to stand outside it -- death functions that way. {Trilling, 1955, #8674@39}

Acknowledges criticism of culture but sees that all coming back to notion that man truly himself  "only if he is in accord with his cultural environment and if the cultural environment is in accord with the best tendencies in man. {Trilling, 1955, #8674@41}

-- note the psychiatric conference in Topeka Kansas on the psychological impact of loyalty oaths and McCarthyism -- {Trilling, 1955, #8674@43}

Trilling realizes that part of Freud's skepticism came from being a Jew in Vienna. Not democratic but did not as the conference would have it impair the functioning of Freud's ego. Family as both conduit into and bulwark against culture. {Trilling, 1955, #8674}

an argument against the overpsychologized -- i.e. over acculturated view -- biology as liberating because culture is not all powerful and residue beyond cultural control {Trilling, 1955, #8674@48}

sees America as seductive rather than coercive and that's the problem individual's defenses against domination of culture become progressively weaker. School replaces family as authority.  "We have come to understand that it is not a low Philistine impulse that leads us to scrutinize with anxiety our children's success in their social life; it is rather a frank, free, generous, democratic, progressive awareness of the charms of Group-Living, an engaging trust -- only the least little bit ironic, and they irony is easily suppressed -- of the natural happiness of man-in-culture or child-in-culture, so long as that culture is not overtly hostile. {Trilling, 1955, #8674@49}

points to greater openness, socialization, cooperation, and reasonableness  as basic tendencies in American life -- some stuff about pedagogic sense of reality being dominant -- hostile to distinction. a kind of equality of mediocrity that comes from trying to integrate individual with society and culture. {Trilling, 1955, #8674@50}

claims we can't really imagine non-conformity at all -- what was admired was the uniformity of manner. no chance taking, adventure without danger intellectually. {Trilling, 1955, #8674@52}

no protection by countervailing cultural forces. Biology is a resistance to and a modification of cultural omnipotence. ((But why glad that some things beyond culture in that the inevitability of biology [at least it was in Freud]  gives us a different task master. Now it could be that the play of biology and culture gives us maneuverability and it may be that biology gives us pleasure but biology is not the realm of pure freedom so Trilling's preference for it is a bit unclear.)) {Trilling, 1955, #8674@53}

right to note that persecution does not destroy egos or super-egos {Trilling, 1955, #8674@56}

When we make it harder to escape culture, cut off the possibility of those triumphs of the mind won in the face of culture, if we impose the idea of a self that is wholly dependent upon the culture for its energy and health. self submitting to culture and being yet in opposition to it conceived SF did of self as being not wholly continuous with culture {Trilling, 1955, #8674@57}
