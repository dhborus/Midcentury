Revivals

While some of the intellectual and cultural landmarks at the end of the midcentury period appeared as culminations of brewing ideas and creative ventures, others might be regarded as returns or revivals of impulses left behind at the start of those years.  Eleanor Flexner’s *Century of Struggle*, the first comprehensive history of the women’s suffrage movement, in 1959 and Betty Friedan’s *Feminine Mystique* in 1963 each in its own way represented the recovery of stirrings in women’s rights dating to the 1940s.  Likewise, a tentative revival in residual Popular Front sensibilities cropped up in the late 1950s, even as the Communist Party USA broke apart in the wake of Nikita Khrushchev’s 1956 denunciation of Stalin.  The actor, concert singer, and left-wing civil rights activist Paul Robeson, who had been blacklisted for his pro-Communist views since 1950, appeared at Carnegie Hall in a comeback concert in May 1959.  A younger member of the left-wing black arts milieu in Harlem, Harry Belafonte, had broken out of Red Scare constraints with a smash hit album of Calypso songs in 1956.  Belafonte gave two Carnegie Hall concerts in April 1959 that reprised, in a more “pop” style, Robeson’s wide-ranging performances featuring African-American, Caribbean, Jewish, and other international folk songs—a kind of left-wing multiculturalism avant la lettre.   

The folk revival of the late 1950s shared with the two singers both repertoire and political overtones. The reputation of “folk” music had declined in the early Cold War years but recovered by the end of the period. “Folk” had roots in the work of song collectors back in the 1890s. It gathered prominence in the 1920s with festivals of regional culture and commercial recordings. By the 1930s, the music had became associated with the Popular Front, in part because such musicians as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger paired lyrics of protest and struggle with old melodies. Further linking the music with the Popular Front was archivist Alan Lomax’s championing the “country” blues of such practitioners as the team of Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee and Hudie Ledbetter (Lead Belly) for its authenticity as the voice of the people. It soon became a staple at venues ranging from union-organizing and anti-fascist rallies to the racially inclusive, left-wing cabaret, Café Society, in New York.  By the late 1940s, while still carrying its political coloring, folk musicians had entered the field of popular music.  Most notably, the singing group the Weavers, featuring Seeger, Lee Hays, Fred Hellerman, and Ronnie Gilbert, had a hit record in 1950 with Lead Belly’s song, “Goodnight, Irene,” but the Red Scare blacklist shut down their access to radio shows and concert halls by 1952.  

Its association with suppressed dissent and its aura of simplicity—signaled by its key instruments banjo, guitar, acoustic bass, and harmonica, contributed to folk music’s appeal to segments of the bohemian underground. That appeal was fostered through the work of an eccentric collector named Harry Smith, who was equally devoted to breaking the color line and exploring esoteric mystical doctrines. In 1952, Smith issued six-record *Anthology of American Folk Music*, culled from nearly forgotten pre-Depression platters of “race” and “hillbilly” songs. The collection would become the “Bible of the folk revival,” a reservoir of hidden knowledge for such young enthusiasts as Ramblin’ Jack Elliott, and Dave Van Ronk and later for a second generation in Joan Baez and Bob Dylan. The sounds had rung through children’s summer camps (especially those with a left-wing heritage) and college-town coffeehouses and in such bohemian neighborhoods as Greenwich Village and Dinkytown in Minneapolis. Its growing audience prompted the founder of the Newport Jazz Festival to add the Newport Folk Festival in 1959.  Although the early pop stars of folk music such as the Kingston Trio (from 1957) and Peter, Paul and Mary (from 1961) gave a white veneer to the genre, the revival retained a cross-racial character.  Odetta, who had begun her folk-singing career in San Francisco’s basement nightclub, the hungry I, attracted great notice with  “Odetta Sings Ballads and Blues” in 1957 for the depth and passion of her singing. Both Baez and Dylan credited her as an influence, with Dylan claiming he traded his electric guitar for an acoustic Gibson after hearing her in a Minneapolis record store. Martin Luther King hailed her as the “Queen of American Folk Music.”

By the early 1960s, critics and audiences celebrated folk music as possessing, as  *New York Times* writer Robert Shelton put it, “the kind of self-expression of a quality music,” especially valuable because it “was home-crafted, homemade, self-developed, free, radical.” Ostensibly stripped of big business glitz and heavy-handed commercial promotion, folk music induced audiences to feel part a new-found communities, drawn together not only by the music but also by informal dress and audience accompaniment of performers. After he tabled his rock 'n' roll aspirations, Dylan cultivated a “low folk” rough and rude manner of presentation and a penchant for political expression similar to that of his hero Woody Guthrie. His "protest" phase eventually gave way to one rooted in Beat poetry. In “A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall” (1963), the two modes seemed to complement one another. Fans acclaimed the song as a chronicle of the horrors of nuclear war provoked by the recklessness of the Cuban Missile Crisis; Dylan characterized as a more general reaction to a culture of war, “of black days, of schism, evil for evil, the common destiny of the human being getting thrown off course.”  

Revivals of late 1940s phenomena can be seen in gay American life. The mass mobilization and single-sex environments that prevailed during war fostered  new gay relations, only to see declines under the force of the Cold War and Red Scare by the early 1950s. Coexistent with the repression was the development of new forms of gay sociability and new styles. “Camp” steadily grew as means of playing with disguise, costume, self-presentation, and coded expressions of pain, pleasure and pathos.  Certain entertainments attracted special devotion in this vein due to the kinds of emotional, performative display they permitted, particularly opera (and charismatic divas), torch-singing, and the like.

By the late 1950s, Judy Garland, who had moved on from child stardom in *The Wizard of Oz* to build great popularity as a stage singer, first in vaudeville-like routines and later as an admired vocalist, had a growing audience of gay fans.  That appeal had diverse sources:  the enduring image from *Oz* of a child’s journey through a fantastic land full of mystery and danger, the lavish production of her stage appearances, the full-throated emotionality of her singing, knowledge of her suffering under the manipulation of movie agents, unhappy marriages, and drug and alcohol addictions.  Under all that pressure, Garland cracked and required a long hospital convalescence in the late 1950s.  She emerged as the new decade began, giving a comeback concert at Carnegie Hall on April 23, 1961, to rapturous acclaim by her devoted fans, the recording industry (the live show became a top-seller as a double-LP album), and music critics.  The event drew hundreds of her fan base among gay men, who rallied to cheer Garland on and share the passionate feeling of connection she created with her audience.  The scene represented an early move from the veiled sexual communities gays had built through the 1950s to a greater visibility in public life.  Garland’s comeback was a kind of collective coming out.
