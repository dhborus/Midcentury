Comment
multiplicity of estrangement forms. monotonous jobs; apathetic voters, juvenile delinquency, “Negroes, who ‘want to be treated like men,” stupefied audiences of the mass media — believe in some commonality among them. {Josephson and Josephson, 1962, #74231@11-2}

Powerlessness. point to the number of psycho-social disorders that fall under the term alienation — loss of self, anxiety states, despair, depersonalization, rootlessness, apathy, social disorganization, loneliness, atomization, powerlessness, meaninglessness, isolation, pessimism, and the loss of beliefs or values.

Merton stress in anomie. key is group breakdown in cultural values, not human response to that breakdown.
Failure to achieve ‘genuine’ self. Cites Mead and Cooley — interaction with others, then a social problem. “What that means is that the person who experiences self-alienation is not only cut off from the springs of his own creativity, but is thereby also cut off from groups of which he would otherwise be a part; and he who fails to achieve a meaningful relationship with others is deprived of some part of himself.” {Josephson and Josephson, 1962, #74231@15}

Veblenian take.  work for consumption is alienating. Centrality of leisure over work as a value (although by no means an actuality)
Alienation from nature and supernatural. Problem here is industrialism and modern life (capitalism is mentioned to a greater extent than one might have expected but the sinews and dynamics of capitalist accumulation are only gestured toward. and move to mass society analysis indicative

Protestantism Capitalism, and alienation from God. “But since Protestantism made man face God alone, without the community of the medieval church, and stressed the fundamental evil and powerlessness of man, a great price was paid for that freedom. That price, as Erich Fromm has so brilliantly described it in Escape From Freedom, was a new and terrible isolation which was accentuated by capitalism. For what Protestantism had started to do in freeing man spiritually, capitalism continued to do in other spheres. But at the same time it made the individual even more alone and isolated and intensified his feelings of insignificance and powerlessness.” {Josephson and Josephson, 1962, #74231@39}

Dangers of mass society. “In short, what is alienating in mass society is not merely the corruption of art, or the power of the multitudes —a power often exaggerated—but more importantly, the atomization of individuals that make up the mass. In that society, as William Kornhauser has suggested, there is a tendency for “the aggregates of individuals [to be] related to one another only by way of their relation to a common authority, especially the state. That is, individuals are not directly related to one another in a variety of independent groups. A population in this condition is not insulated in any way from the ruling group, nor yet from elements within itself.” {Josephson and Josephson, 1962, #74231@42} loss of civil society and shock absorber argument and undercuts traditional human groupings to which belonging gave identity.

Mass society II. guides mass audience into opinions— people target of manipulation efforts. Quoting Merton: “In place of a sense of Gemeinschaft—genuine community of values—there intrudes pseudo-Gemeinschaft — the feigning of personal concern with the other fellow in order to manipulate him the better.” Josephsons continue “No wonder that in this most alienated of societies the slogan ’togetherness’ was first promoted by an advertiser.” {Josephson and Josephson, 1962, #74231@43}
