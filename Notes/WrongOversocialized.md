The Oversocialized Conception of Man in Modern Sociology — Dennis Wrong


Note the insistence on universality to some problems. 
Hobbesian question — how are men capable of the guidance by social norms and goals that makes an enduring society possible; Marxist question how and destructive conflicts restrained. 
Claims the internalization and seeking for approval model eliminates the Hobbesian question and lead to inquiry of how violence is possible at all. 
Oversocialized men are conformists — feel guilty if they do not; contrast with Freud in which superego conformity has most internalized social norms and is the most wracked with guilt and anxiety. {Wrong, 1961, #13900@187}
Turns to Freud in which people repress themselves imposing checks on own desires and turn the inner life into a battlefield of conflict motives - sociologists have abandoned notion of id. “Deviant behavior is accounted for by special circumstances: ambiguous norms, anomie, role conflict, or greater cultural stress on valued goals than on the approved means for attaining them. “ {Wrong, 1961, #13900@187} 
no motivational forces to buck society; little recognition of coercion in conformity 
if one fundamental motive considered by many sociologists as mistake, nonetheless search for approval passes by unremarked upon. and unchallenged. 
See page 190 for Wrong’s argument that great sociology stood against abstract conceptions of humankind and implies that the oversocialization is the present-day version. 
suggests internalization runs counter to approval and has been hollowed out to make it more useful as an explanation of conformity.” Misses material and sensual satisfactions. denies dialectic between conformity and rebellion. 
Wrong turns first to the body — sociologists scared off by biological determinism specter. “To psychoanalysis man is indeed a social animal; his social nature is profoundly reflected in his body structure.” a social animal without being a socialized animal. {Wrong, 1961, #13900@192}

underline [page 4]: "Hobbesian question— the "problem of order," as he calls it—at the very beginning of his first book,"
highlight [page 4]: "His solution, however, has tended to become precisely the kind of elaboration of a set of answers in ab- straction from questions that is so character- istic of contemporary sociological theory."
note [page 4]: "Parsons as abstractor."
underline [page 5]: "Constraint, therefore, is more than an environmental obstacle which the actor must take into account in pursuit of his goals in the same way that he takes into account physical laws: it becomes internal, psycho- logical, and self-imposed as well."
note [page 5]: "Uses a rather incidental piece of writing and textbooks because they simplify the issue and reveal the implicit assumptions."
highlight [page 6]: "The main explanatory function of the concept is to show how people repress themselves, imposing checks on their own de- sires and thus turning the inner life into a battlefield of conflicting motives, no matter which side "wins," by successfully dictating overt action. So far as behavior is concerned, the psychoanalytic view of man is less deter- ministic than the sociological. For psycho- analysis is primarily concerned with the inner life, not with overt behavior, and its most fundamental insight is that the wish, the emotion, and the fantasy are as important as the act in man's experience"
note [page 6]: "Condemns notion that internalization means learning or habit-formation. “The whole stress on inner conflict, on the tension between powerful impulses and superego controls the behavioral outcome of which cannot be prejudged, drops out of the pictures. {Wrong, 1961, #13900@187}"
note [page 6]: "internalization in Freud’s sense is that the individual will feel guilt if he does not live up to norm, not that he will {Wrong, 1961, #13900@187}"
note [page 6]: "What is overlooked here is that the person who conforms may be even more "bothered," that is, subject to guilt and neurosis, than the person who violates what are not only society's norms but his own as well. To Freud, it is precisely the man with the strictest superego, he who has most thoroughly internalized and conformed to the norms of his society, who is most wracked with guilt and anxiety. {Wrong, 1961, #13900@187}"
note [page 6]: "Key criticism “Deviant be- havior is accounted for by special circum- stances: ambiguous norms, anomie, role con- flict, or greater cultural stress on valued goals than on the approved means for attaining them.” {Wrong, 1961, #13900@187}"
note [page 7]: "Notes that some fail to develop superegos and are in fact coerced into conformity."
underline [page 8]: "But his view that all men are to some degree both inner-directed and other-directed, a qualification that has been somewhat neglected by critics who have understandably concentrated on his empirical and historical use of his typology, suggests the more generalized conception of forces making for conformity found in current theory"
underline [page 8]: "" In some respects Riesman's conception of character is Freudian rather than neo- Freudian: character is defined by superego me- chanisms and, like Freud in Civilization and Its Discontents, the socialized individual is defined by what is forbidden him rather than by what society stimulates him to do. Thus in spite of Riesman's generally sanguine attitude towards modern Amer- ica, implicit in his typology is a view of society as the enemy both of individuality and of basic drive gratification, a view that contrasts with the at least potentially benign role assigned it by neo- Freudian thinkers like Fromm and Homey.""
note [page 8]: "On priority of socialized or social motives. When values are " inferred" from this em- phasis and then popularized, it becomes the basis of the ideology of " groupism" extolling the virtues of " togetherness" and "belongingness" that have been attacked and satirized so savagely in recent social criticism. {Wrong, 1961, #13900@188-9}"
note [page 8]: "Interesting."
underline [page 9]: "Man is increasingly seen as a "role-playing" creature, responding eagerly or anxiously to the expectations of other role-players in the multiple group settings in which he finds himself."
note [page 9]: "Role playing gets us complexity of differentiated social structure but ends up with a simplified social psychology."
note [page 10]: "Where are material interests, asks Wrong? {Wrong, 1961, #13900@191}"
underline [page 11]: "When Freud defined psychoanalysis as the study of the "vicissitudes of the in- stincts," he was confirming, not denying, the "plasticity" of human nature insisted on by social scientists. The drives or " instincts" of psychoanalysis, far from being fixed disposi- tions to behave in a particular way, are utterly subject to social channelling and transformation and could not even reveal themselves in behavior without social mold- ing any more than our vocal chords can produce articulate speech if we have not learned a language. To psychoanalysis man is indeed a social animal; his social nature is profoundly reflected in his bodily struc- ture. 34"
underline [page 11]: "To Freud man is a social animal without being entirely a so- cialized animal. His very social nature is the source of conflicts and antagonisms that create resistance to socialization by the norms of any of the societies which have existed in the course of human history."
underline [page 11]: "All men are so- cialized in the latter sense, but this does not mean that they have been completely molded by the particular norms and values of their culture."
