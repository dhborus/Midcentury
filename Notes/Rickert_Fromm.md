note [page 9]: "Libidinal theory makes it impossible to carry on with Marx-Freud synthesis. Can’t sustain sense that any social group defined by its social (group, collective) character and 2) that socioeconomic situation molds the social character."

note [page 23]: "No domination of one part of individual by another."
underline [page 24]: "By focusing exclusively on drive theory as the radical core of psychoanalysis and articulating his vision within the framework this theory provides, Marcuse is led to put forth an asocial and hyperindividualistic view of society as well as a conception of liberation that essentially conceives of "people as children and as male.""
note [page 24]: "Interesting that Marcuse, who comes from a school that sees itself as adulthood yet envisions liberation as childhood permanent."

underline [page 31]: "The boy's submission may, for example, create intense hostility toward the father that, because it is too frightening to acknowledge, is repressed. Though not manifest, the unconscious hostility acts as a dynamic factor in the boy's character structure, generating still further reactions: it may, for example, create new anxiety that in turn may lead to greater submis- sion or to vague feelings of defiance directed against life in general"
underline [page 32]: "deed, two of its leading critics remarked that in abandoning a sociological approach, Adorno and his co-authors "take the irrationality out of the social order and impute it to the respondent, and by means of this substitution, it is decided that prejudiced respondents derive their judg- ments in an irrational way." 136"
