Thoughts on computer going forward in order to decide the Ulysses question

Ulysses is $30 a year -- by no means exorbitant, but not entirely necessary either.

Choice #1: Keep Mac orientation. Ulysses notes and writing -- can use iPad as mobile device. Next upgrade with an iPad. Bookends as bibliography program. DocDown as the conversion program. Copy notes to DTPO for storage. Scapple for graphing and jotting.

Advantages: simple, straightforward. No messing around with Linux. Key is to take losses and scale back other programs. Keeps iCloud as storage locale.

Disadvantages: At some point Mac OS with be too advanced for hardware or the hardware will break down. Can prepare for this by keeping the laptop Linux and backup Ulysses on Atom.

Choice #2: Drop Ulysses; Do Scrivener and Atom. Former for notes in Dreams project. With Scrivener, I can move between iPad and Desktops, although the move to Markdown came from the difficulties in syncing. Atom works better, I think, and keeps open the possibility of using Linux. Only problem: Atom does not work and will not be made for iPad. Can use IA Writer and save to iCloud.

Choice #3Linux laptop -- one machine. But this will not have Word, which I think I still need.
